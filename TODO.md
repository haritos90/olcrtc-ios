# TODO

Task ledger for olcrtc-ios. Every task has a permanent numeric ID and flows
**Backlog → Open → Closed**. This is the single place work is tracked;
`AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` point here.

## How this file works

**Lifecycle**

1. **New task** → add a row to **Backlog**, and (if the title isn't enough) a
   block under **Details** with the full description.
2. **Work starts** → move the row to **Open**.
3. **Finished** → move the row to **Closed**, fill the **Resolution** column (how
   it was resolved — or `Won't Do` / `Duplicate` for rejected tasks), fill the
   **Release note** column (#315 — see below), and **delete its Details block**.

A rejected or duplicate task is also closed (Resolution `Won't Do` / `Duplicate`);
there is no separate "won't do" list. Detail blocks exist only for **Open +
Backlog** tasks. Closed tasks are title-only history plus the **Resolution** note —
their full setup descriptions are intentionally not kept.

**Release note** (#315) — one short, user-facing "what's new" sentence describing
the change, filled in when the row is closed. `scripts/closed-tasks-since.py`
puts **this column** (not the verbose Resolution) into the GitHub Release notes;
put `—` when there's nothing worth announcing (internal-only change) — the
script then falls back to the task title. Rows closed before #315 carry `—`.

**Columns**

- **Pri** — `P0` critical (correctness / security / broken) · `P1` high ·
  `P2` medium · `P3` low / nice-to-have.
- **Eff** — `XS` ≤ 15 min · `S` ≤ 1 h · `M` ≤ ½ day · `L` ≤ 2 days · `XL` > 2 days.
- **Theme** — security · reliability · architecture · parity (server↔client wire
  contract) · tests · observability · ux · docs · build · l10n · features ·
  migration · accessibility · performance · settings.

**Sorting** — every table (Open, Backlog, Closed) and the Details blocks are kept
in **ascending ID** order.

**Layout** — Open and Backlog come first, then their **Details** blocks, then the
**Closed** history last, so the active work and its descriptions stay at the top.

**Table formats** — never delete a section's table when it empties; keep the header
rows so the structure survives and nothing has to be rebuilt from scratch. The columns are:

- **Open** / **Backlog** — `| ID | Pri | Eff | Theme | Title |`
- **Closed** — `| ID | Theme | Title | Resolution | Release note |`
  (#315 was: 4 columns, no Release note — `closed-tasks-since.py` still parses
  the old shape at historic git refs)

When **Open** has no rows, keep the header + separator and leave a single placeholder
row — `| — | — | — | — | _(empty — promote one from Backlog)_ |` — instead of replacing
the table with prose.

**Next free ID:** 347

## Details (Open + Backlog only)

### 097 — SEI/VIDEO env vars end-to-end OR remove

Server reads `OLCRTC_VIDEO_*` and `OLCRTC_SEI_*`; the client never sets them. Either
expose them in `SettingsStore` + `InstallOptionsView` (~14 sliders), or commit to a
"VP8-only client" and drop the dead branches from `scripts/srv.sh`. The UI hint from
#087 buys time but is a placeholder.

### 112 — NetworkExtension packet tunnel

Full-device VPN (route every app, not just SOCKS-aware ones) needs a NetworkExtension
Packet Tunnel provider + the `packet-tunnel-provider` entitlement, which requires a paid
($99/yr) Apple Developer account. The standard pattern — confirmed by olcbox, a 5-platform
olcrtc client — is to keep running the olcrtc core as a local SOCKS5 and bridge TUN↔SOCKS5
with [`hev-socks5-tunnel`](https://github.com/heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel) inside the
`PacketTunnelProvider`. Worth noting even olcbox skipped iOS TUN (its iOS target is
SOCKS5-only — "a Swift shell"), so this is high-effort / low-ROI and gated on the paid
account.

### 115 — TestFlight

Stand up the App Store Connect app record and a TestFlight build for internal
testing. Prerequisites: a real app icon (#248), the privacy manifest (#249), and
signing (set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`). On-device testing over cellular and inside RU
networks is already handled by the maintainer — this task is only the TestFlight
pipeline (archive → upload → internal testers).

### 235 — Failover profiles: multi-carrier iOS install

**BLOCKED on #247.** Server-side failover is supported — `internal/config` parses
`profiles:` / `failover:`, and `cmd/olcrtc/main.go` drives them through
`internal/supervisor` (runs profiles in order; on a session drop it waits
`retry_delay` and advances, up to `max_cycles`). `srv.sh` could emit a multi-profile
`server.yaml`:

```yaml
mode: srv
profiles:
  - name: jitsi-primary
    auth: { provider: jitsi }
    room: { id: "https://meet1.arbitr.ru/myroom" }
  - name: telemost-fallback
    auth: { provider: telemost }
    room: { id: "telemost-room-id" }
failover: { retry_delay: 5s, max_cycles: 3 }
```

The blocker: client and server rendezvous in the **same conferencing room**, and a
profile switch changes carrier *and* room (`config.ApplyProfile`). The bundled
`Mobile.xcframework` is single-session only — `mobile/mobile.go` exposes
`Start`/`StartWithTransport`/`Stop` and imports neither `config` nor `supervisor`, so
the iOS client has no way to follow the server's switch; when the server moves it is
left calling an empty room. A server-only multi-profile install is therefore *worse*
than none on iOS. #247 (failover in the gomobile binding) must land first.

Once unblocked, the iOS work is: `InstallOptions` gains a list of `FailoverProfile`
(carrier + roomID); `InstallOptionsView` gets an "Add fallback carrier" button;
`SSHRunner` generates multi-profile YAML; `ConnectionRecord` represents a
multi-profile connection (which roomID/carrier to show); `TunnelManager` drives the
client failover loop exposed by #247.

### 247 — Failover/profiles in the gomobile binding

Prerequisite for #235. The server cycles failover profiles (`internal/supervisor`,
wired in `cmd/olcrtc/main.go`), but the iOS client binding
(`olcrtc-upstream/mobile/mobile.go`) is single-session and has no way to follow a
carrier/room switch. Expose a profile-aware client entry point — an ordered list of
carrier/room/transport that the client cycles through, mirroring the server's
`retry_delay` / `max_cycles` — or a lighter "reconnect across an ordered carrier list
until the server is found" loop. Needs upstream Go work in `mobile/` (the existing
`supervisor.Runner` is the *server* session runner; a client-side supervisor doesn't
exist yet) plus a `Mobile.xcframework` rebuild. Until this lands, end-to-end failover
on iOS is only achievable via an app-level Swift loop whose client/server convergence
is best-effort (they can sit on different profiles during the detection-skew window).

**Decision (2026-06-04): UPSTREAM-only — do not fork or patch the submodule locally.**
CI (`ci.yml`), `release.yml`, and every cloner's `fetch-framework.sh` build the framework
from the *pinned* upstream commit, so a local edit to `olcrtc-upstream/mobile/mobile.go`
would build on the maintainer's machine but break CI and every clone (the published
framework wouldn't carry the new symbol, and the Swift calling it wouldn't link). The
client entry point — sketch `StartWithProfiles(profilesSpec, clientID, keyHex, socksPort,
socksUser, socksPass, retryDelayMillis, maxCycles)`: cycle an ordered carrier/room/transport
list in the existing singleton slot, reusing `client.RunWithReady` with a per-profile
handshake-timeout advance, mirroring `internal/supervisor`'s `retry_delay`/`max_cycles` —
must therefore land in **upstream** `mobile/mobile.go`. Re-check on each `olcrtc-upstream`
pull (the #260-style integration); **close when upstream ships it**, after which the iOS
side is only an `OlcrtcEngine` wiring + a framework rebuild.

### 254 — CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Adopt the standard Contributor Covenant. The only decision is the enforcement-contact
method (a maintainer email, or "via GitHub private report") to fill the template
placeholder. Community-health hygiene; not blocking the first push.

### 257 — Privacy-policy document

App Store submission requires a privacy-policy URL even when the app collects nothing.
Write a short policy ("no personal data collected or transmitted; the encryption key and
SSH credentials never leave the device / Keychain") and host it (GitHub Pages or a gist),
then link it from App Store Connect and the README. Distinct from the in-bundle privacy
manifest (#249).

### 279 — Message catalog: typed, error-coded client + server messages

Define a **table of known conditions → messages** for both client and server, each with a
**type** (info / warn / error) and a stable **error code**, emitted into the logs when its
condition fires. Make the codes **searchable** and cross-referenced with the README
troubleshooting section, so a user hitting code `Cxx`/`Sxx` can look it up. **Prereq:** the
maintainer will send real container logs so we can pick which server-side conditions are worth
catching (e.g. room-missing → #275). Pairs with #276's level colour-coding.

**Seed catalog from a real `podman logs` capture (2026-06, telemost/vp8channel).** Server core lines
carry *no* level tag (only the bundled pion `[pc]`/`[ice]` lines do) — assign:
- `info` — `Connecting transport=… carrier=…` (session start), `Link connected` (control link up),
  `session opened: id=… device=… claims=…` / `session … opened (peer=…)` (peer joined the room ✓),
  `session closed: … reason=…` (peer left), `Shutting down gracefully…`;
- `warn` — `control missed pong on server … missed_pongs=N` (liveness degrading; escalate to **error**
  at N≥3 → imminent drop, the server-side mirror of our keep-alive loss);
- `debug/noise` — `sid=N connect/connected host:port`, `traffic: session=… addr=… in=N out=N`
  (very verbose — ~22% of lines; default-hidden), `vp8channel: KCP started` / `peer session created`,
  and the benign pion noise (`[pc] WARN: …stream is already closed`, `…PayloadType…(EOF)`,
  `[ice] WARN: Failed to ping without candidate pairs`, `[ice] INFO: Failed to send packet… network
  is unreachable` = IPv6-unreachable spam).
There were **no error-level lines in a healthy run** — true errors (carrier-auth, room-not-found,
panic) need a failing capture. Note the **server timestamp is Go's `2006/01/02 15:04:05`** (slashes,
second precision, no millis) — #277/#278 must reformat + tolerate the missing `.SSS`.

**Catalog seeded → [`docs/diagnostic-messages.md`](diagnostic-messages.md)** (client `OLC-1xxx` + server
`OLC-2xxx`, typed I/W/E, one continuous unique code space, from real client + server captures). #279 is
now the *wiring*: emit these coded lines from the right places (and detect the 🟡-planned ones), make the
codes searchable in the merged Logs stream (#276), and cross-link from the README troubleshooting.

### 299 — Theme = real colour schemes (Dark / Light / Gray)

**User wants this prioritised.** The current "Theme" picker (Refined/Console — #267/#281) only changes
corner radii + border weight; it does **not** change colours, which is what "Theme" should mean. Replace
it with **Dark / Light / Gray** colour schemes that actually swap the palette (`Theme.Palette`). The app
is currently forced-dark (`UIUserInterfaceStyle=Dark` in project.yml) — Light/Gray require lifting that
and authoring light + neutral-gray palettes while keeping the design-system component structure. Drop
the shape/border-only "design direction" framing.

### 321 — README: rewrite iPhone-install + merge build sections

Two changes to `README.md`, ordered so a newbie hits "how do I get this on my iPhone"
before any build talk, and a dev still finds "how do I build this" right after.

**1. Rewrite "Install without Xcode (sideload)"** around the two most user-friendly
sideloading apps, primary then alternative:

- **Primary: [SideStore](https://sidestore.io)** — AltStore-based, refreshes apps over
  Wi-Fi without a cable.
- **Alternative: [LiveContainer](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer)** — runs
  sideloaded apps inside a container app, no per-app re-signing dance.
- Link the **iLoader** repos for installing SideStore/LiveContainer themselves (the
  no-computer-needed install path for the sideloading app).
- Cover **LocalDevVPN** for auto-renewing the 7-day signature, with the concrete steps
  for both SideStore and LiveContainer (where the option lives, what it needs).
- Highlight the convenient flow: copy the `.ipa` asset link straight from the
  [GitHub Release](../../releases) page and paste it into SideStore/LiveContainer's
  "add from URL" — the app downloads and installs it directly, no manual `.ipa`
  download/transfer step.
- Keep the existing AltStore/Sideloadly + cable-based instructions too (still valid,
  more familiar to some), but as the secondary/manual path — push detail into a
  `<details>` block like the current "Build the .ipa yourself" does, so the section
  stays scannable.

**2. New "Build it yourself" section** — merge the current **Build and run**,
**Updating**, and the two `<details>` blocks *Building `Mobile.xcframework` from
source* and *Build the .ipa yourself* into one section covering: clone + submodule,
fetch/build the framework, `xcodegen`, build & run in Xcode, building the unsigned
`.ipa`, and pulling updates. Place it **after** the (rewritten) sideload section and
**before** "Project structure" — sideload-only readers never need to scroll past it.
Keep the `<details>` pattern for the toolchain-setup and from-source build steps so the
top-level flow stays short.

Throughout: optimize for a first-time reader to find the SideStore install path
immediately, while a developer can still find "build it myself" right below — push
anything more detailed than that into `<details>`, matching the existing README style.

### 325 — parity_check 2.0: two-way, line-classified srv.sh parity

Today `parity_check.py` checks one direction only: every non-comment line of ours
outside `# boc/eoc` must exist *somewhere* in upstream's srv.sh (set membership).
Upstream **additions pass silently** — after the #319 bump, 156 upstream lines
(the interactive carrier/Jitsi/room menus) are absent from our copy, all
deliberately, but none of those decisions is recorded anywhere, and a future
upstream addition (a new required env var, an install step) would stay invisible.
Redesign, per operator decision (2026-06-12):

1. **Rejected upstream lines stay in our file, commented, with the reason.**
   Every upstream line we deliberately do NOT adopt is carried in
   `scripts/srv.sh` as a commented-out verbatim copy inside a dedicated marker
   pair, e.g. `# boc olcrtc-ios-rejected: <why we don't take this>` …each
   upstream line prefixed `# `… `# eoc olcrtc-ios-rejected` (exact syntax TBD at
   implementation; must stay shell-safe and distinct from plain `boc/eoc`).
   Start by backfilling the current 156 lines (non-interactive install replaces
   the menus — `OLCRTC_*` env vars).
2. **Line-by-line loop instead of set membership.** The checker walks both
   files and classifies every line of ours — `same-as-upstream` / `rejected`
   (commented copy inside a rejected block) / `ours` (inside `boc/eoc`) — and
   every upstream line — `adopted` / `rejected` / `unaccounted`. Order-aware
   where possible: set membership today can't see moved or duplicated lines.
3. **Fail in both directions.** Fail when (a) one of our base lines no longer
   exists in upstream (today's check), or (b) an upstream line is
   `unaccounted` — neither adopted nor explicitly rejected. The error text
   tells the operator to adopt the new upstream lines OR wrap them as
   rejected-with-reason, **and to file a TODO task for the triage decision**
   ("what do we take, what do we skip, and why").
4. Keep it a pre-build phase; update CONTRIBUTING.md → *srv.sh parity* and
   AGENTS.md §3 to describe the new marker and the two-way contract.

### 327 — Routing switch: make "All direct" affect the actual tunnel

The Routing segmented control on the Connections tab (`RoutingMode`:
`.allTunnel` / `.allDirect`, #273) **only reroutes the app's own diagnostics
traffic** — IP check and speed test via `currentMode`
(ConnectionsView.swift:53) — while the actual tunnel is untouched: external
apps pointed at the SOCKS port keep going through the carrier regardless of
the switch. The UI promises a global kill switch ("tunnel off but stay
connected", per the RoutingMode.swift design comment) that doesn't exist.

Make `.allDirect` apply to the real SOCKS path: traffic entering the local
SOCKS port relays **directly** instead of through the carrier, without
dropping the carrier session. `Mobile.objc.h` exposes no direct/bypass mode
(verified 2026-06-12), so this almost certainly needs an upstream/core
addition (a runtime bypass toggle on the running client) — pairs with the
#247 pattern (UPSTREAM-only work + xcframework rebuild). Until the core
supports it, consider an interim honest-UX step: label the switch as
affecting diagnostics only.

### 328 — Carrier endpoints with one-tap copy (proxy-loop exclusions)

When an external app (e.g. Shadowrocket) routes *all* traffic through the
olcrtc SOCKS port, the tunnel's own carrier traffic (the Jitsi/telemost server)
must bypass the proxy or it loops. Today it's hard to tell which addresses to
exclude. Show, for the active connection, the carrier endpoints actually in
use — at minimum the carrier base host (e.g. `meet1.arbitr.ru`), its currently
resolved IPs (they rotate, so copy both host and IPs), and STUN/TURN hosts if
used — each one-tap copyable, with a short "add these as DIRECT rules in your
proxy app" hint. Sources: the `OlcrtcConnection` params + a resolver pass;
check what `Mobile.objc.h` exposes about live ICE endpoints before promising
IP-level accuracy.

### 329 — Kick participants + close the room on server stop

When the olcrtc server stops, the conference room currently stays open with
stale participants. Wanted: on server stop the server kicks all participants
and closes/ends the room — gated by a setting, **default ON**. Carrier-
dependent (Jitsi: end conference; telemost/wbstream: TBD) and likely needs
core/upstream support — check what the core exposes at shutdown before
scoping. Probably splits into an upstream change + an iOS toggle (Settings +
an `OLCRTC_*` env var through srv.sh, boc-patched).

### 331 — Provisioning vs Container logs: split by line origin (proposal)

Overlap: during install/start the provisioning stream carries the script's
output, which includes the container's own startup lines; "Download logs"
later re-pulls those same lines into the per-server container log — the two
tabs largely repeat each other. Proposed split — classify by **origin**, not
by operation:

- **provisioning** keeps orchestration only: SSH steps, script phase markers,
  ✓/✗ statuses, errors;
- anything **produced by the container itself** (the `podman logs` output, the
  container-startup tail inside the install output) always routes to the
  per-server container log (#295), even when it arrives during provisioning;
- at each hand-off, provisioning logs one pointer line ("container output →
  Container tab") so the narrative stays followable.

Implementation sketch: the install/start paths in `SSHRunner`/`Provisioning`
detect the container-output section of the script output and feed it through
`logContainer` instead of `.provisioning`. Once every line has exactly one
home, no dedupe pass is needed.

### 332 — Logs pipeline performance (proposal)

Symptoms: disconnect takes seconds (teardown log storm), the Logs screen
stutters, long sessions degrade (#336). Causes, confirmed in code:

1. every appended line does two synchronous `FileHandle.write`s on the main
   actor (`LogFileWriter.write`, LogStore.swift:152);
2. `revision` bumps per line and **all four Logs tabs** observe the store —
   `TabView` keeps off-screen tabs alive, so each line re-runs
   `LogRendering.filtered` + `attributed` over the whole buffer ×4 (#294
   retired the #289 visibility gate on the assumption off-screen tabs don't
   re-render; `@ObservedObject` re-evaluates them anyway);
3. each render rebuilds one monolithic `AttributedString` — O(buffer) per
   appended line, no incremental diffing.

Proposal, in payoff order:

- **coalesce UI updates**: debounce `revision` so views see at most ~4
  updates/s regardless of log rate — the storm-proofing that fixes disconnect;
- **restore per-tab visibility gating** (`.onAppear`/`.onDisappear` per tab)
  so only the visible tab rebuilds;
- **move file writes off the main actor** (serial background queue or a small
  buffered writer actor, flushed off-main);
- **cap rendered lines** (newest ~500 with a "truncated — share/export for
  full history" header) independent of the buffer cap; only if still needed,
  switch to a `List` of per-line `Text` rows for incremental diffing.

### 333 — Port "busy" right after disconnect (proposal)

After stopping the tunnel, the SOCKS port reads busy for a few seconds (the
core's listener teardown is asynchronous / the socket lingers), so an
immediate reconnect fails on our own ghost. The #308 contract stays untouched:
bind exactly the configured port, typed "port busy" error, **no port sliding**.
Proposal:

- first check the disconnect path: if we can await the core's listener close
  before reporting "disconnected", the window disappears at the source (and
  check whether the core can set `SO_REUSEADDR` upstream);
- client-side mitigation: on connect, if the configured port is busy AND we
  disconnected ourselves within the last ~10 s, wait-and-retry the **same**
  port (poll ~every 250 ms, up to ~5 s, with a "waiting for port release…"
  status) before surfacing the typed busy error.

### 337 — Hide IPs in the UI (screenshot-safe mode)

A **Settings toggle** (off by default) that masks IP addresses in the UI so
screenshots can be shared safely. Scope: the Diagnostics block on the
Connections tab (IP-check result rows) and Manage VPS (host addresses on
server cards / detail). **Logs are deliberately excluded** — they stay
unmasked. Mask style up to the implementer (e.g. keep the last octet:
`•••.•••.•.12`); masking is display-only — copy actions and the underlying
stored values stay real.

| 156 | ux | VPS Reboot has no confirmation dialog — reboots the whole VPS without warning |  | — |

| 158 | ux | Transport picker in AddConnectionView shows all 4 transports regardless of carrier compatibility — should grey out incompatible ones |  | — |
| 159 | ux | LogsView shows oldest first; user must scroll to bottom to see latest — add auto-scroll-to-bottom on appear and on new entries |  | — |

| 161 | ux | AddServerHostView port field uses numberPad but no Done button to dismiss keyboard |  | — |
| 162 | ux | IP check results show no timestamp — stale results look like fresh ones; add "last checked HH:mm" label |  | — |
| 163 | ux | Client ID field default "default" is confusing — add footer explaining it is used to identify this client in multi-client rooms |  | — |
| 164 | ux | Connections server row: pencil Edit button visible AND Edit in context menu — duplicated; remove inline button, keep in context menu only |  | — |
| 165 | ux | Onboarding: first launch shows empty Connections with no workflow guide — add empty-state text explaining Add VPS → Install → Connect flow |  | — |
| 166 | ux | LogsView: no per-category Clear button — "Clear all" nukes everything; add clear per selected category |  | — |
| 167 | ux | Add "Set as primary + Connect" context menu action in Connections list — currently requires two taps (tap to set primary, then toggle) |  | — |
| 168 | ux | InstallOptionsView carrier segmented control: 4 carriers (incl jitsi) is tight on small screen — consider wheel/inline Picker |  | — |
| 169 | ux | AddServerHostView: no "Test SSH connection" button before installing — users discover SSH failure only when install starts |  | — |
| 170 | ux | VPS tab: no guidance after install ("Connection added — go to Connections tab to connect"); users don't know next step |  | — |
| 171 | ux | AddConnectionView: SOCKS5 auth footer says "server started with -socksuser/-sockspass" but these are LOCAL proxy credentials — fix description |  | — |
| 172 | ux | Connections: show current SOCKS proxy port below the global toggle when connected ("proxy :8808") |  | — |
| 173 | ux | Logs: "Share" sends all logs as text blob — add option to share only last N lines or selected category |  | — |
| 174 | ux | VPS server state machine: centralize state, hide/show menu items based on state (no container → no Remove/Update/Stop/Reconfigure) |  | — |
| 175 | ux | Proxy port displays with thousands separator ("8 808") — use .grouping(.never) formatting everywhere |  | — |
| 176 | reliability | TunnelManager state glitch: UI shows Connected after manual disconnect; toggle inconsistent — needs investigation |  | — |
| 177 | ux | SOCKS port check shows "busy" when port is in use by us (connected) — show "in use by tunnel" instead |  | — |
| 178 | ux | Jitsi in CarrierTransportMatrix: mark as .unknown/.notImplemented across all transports — not yet available on master branch |  | — |
| 179 | ux | "Update" menu item label unclear — rename to "Update binary (git pull + rebuild)" or add subtitle explaining what is updated |  | — |
| 180 | ux | Start/Stop container: replace two separate menu items with a single toggle in the VPS card (like the Connect toggle in Connections tab) |  | — |
| 181 | ux | Context menu shows Start even when container is running (status not synced with menu) — gate on latest known status |  | — |
| 182 | ux | VPS card status dot area: merge status dot + stats row into one unified status line; move readiness text there |  | — |
| 183 | ux | SOCKS port Save: explicit Save button with feedback | Won't Do | — |
| 184 | reliability | SettingsStore: redundant didSet clamping loop — value = v triggers didSet again causing double UserDefaults write |  | — |
| 185 | reliability | SSHRunner: `fatalError("unreachable")` in `connect()` — replace with `preconditionFailure` to avoid release crashes |  | — |
| 186 | reliability | Provisioning.reconfigure: returns nil URI silently if server didn't emit OLCRTC_URI — UI shows success but ConnectionRecord not updated; should throw |  | — |
| 187 | reliability | ConnectionsView: `shareConn = nil; DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter { qrConn = conn }` — race if view dismissed before delay fires; use onDisappear instead |  | — |
| 188 | ux | ServersView: `foundContainers` not cleared when scan sheet dismissed — old results flash briefly on next scan |  | — |
| 189 | observability | KeychainHelper: failure logs missing numeric OSStatus code — hard to debug Keychain errors without the code |  | — |
| 190 | reliability | TunnelManager keep-alive: guard check happens after `verifyTunnel()` call — one wasted network probe after disconnect; add guard before sleep |  | — |
| 191 | reliability | OlcrtcURI: invalid payload key-value pairs silently dropped — log warning for malformed values (e.g. `vp8-batch=abc`) |  | — |
| 192 | build | SSHRunner `_execute()` / `_withConnection()`: missing `@discardableResult` on internal helpers — will produce compiler warnings when warnings enabled |  | — |
| 193 | observability | Provisioning.start() and probeReadiness() missing LogStore.startSession() — inconsistent with all other Provisioner methods |  | — |
| 194 | reliability | NetPing: timeout DispatchWorkItem not cancelled after connection succeeds — fires anyway and wastes resources |  | — |
| 195 | reliability | SubscriptionFetcher: silent empty-string fallback when data can't be decoded as UTF-8 or latin1 — corrupted data treated as valid empty response |  | — |
| 196 | reliability | ConnectionStore.load: JSON decode failure is silent — corrupted UserDefaults loses all connections with no log or user notification |  | — |
| 197 | security | OlcrtcConnection.socksPass is Codable — if struct is ever encoded outside ConnectionStore.scrub() path, password leaks to JSON |  | — |
| 198 | reliability | OlcrtcURI: mixed bracket types in payload (e.g. `transport[bad>@room`) silently misparse — no guard against malformed bracket nesting |  | — |
| 199 | reliability | AddConnectionView: @State form fields not reset when sheet re-presented in create mode — old values persist from previous session |  | — |
| 200 | reliability | SettingsView: socksPassLoaded flag not reset on sheet disappear — SOCKS password not reloaded if changed externally |  | — |
| 201 | reliability | AddServerHostView: Test SSH Task not cancelled on sheet dismiss — updates @State after view gone causing SwiftUI warnings |  | — |
| 202 | reliability | LogsView: cachedFullText not updated when selected category changes — switching tabs shows stale log from previous category |  | — |
| 203 | performance | LogStore.timestamp(): DateFormatter created on every log call — cache as static let to avoid 60×/sec allocations during slider drag |  | — |
| 204 | performance | LogStore.redactSecrets(): two NSRegularExpression compiled on every log call — cache as static let |  | — |
| 205 | reliability | SpeedTest: result.error always nil even when all measurements fail — can't distinguish "all nil = all failed" from "all nil = not run yet" |  | — |
| 206 | reliability | InstallOptionsView: SEI params (seiFPS/Batch/Frag/ACK) not reset when transport changes away from seichannel — stale values submitted |  | — |
| 207 | observability | ServersView: readiness[host.id] not cleared at start of operation — stale dot/label shows briefly between op start and probe result |  | — |
| 208 | ux | AddServerHostView: "Test SSH" button label hardcoded EN — needs L10n key |  | — |
| 209 | ux | ServersView: deep uninstall confirmation body hardcoded EN — needs L10n key |  | — |
| 210 | accessibility | QRCodeView: QR image has no accessibilityLabel — screen readers can't describe it |  | — |
| 211 | accessibility | FormField: label text not linked to input via accessibilityLabel — screen readers can't associate them |  | — |
| 212 | accessibility | ConnectionsView speed metrics: Ping/DL/UL VStack not accessible as a unit — screen reader reads raw numbers without context |  | — |
| 213 | reliability | SSHRunner.shellSafe(): uses `.reduce(into:)` appending unicodeScalars — use `String(s.unicodeScalars.filter{...})` single allocation instead |  | — |
| 214 | ux | Manage VPS global status banner: replace with per-server inline progress inside host card — global banner makes no sense with multiple servers |  | — |
| 215 | ux | VPS action buttons: switch to icon-only (no text labels) with tooltip; duplicate all actions in context menu with same icons |  | — |
| 216 | ux | IP Check: collapse to "✓ 5.42.103.58 (3 sources)" when all agree; expand with ⚠️ only when IPs differ (potential DNS leak) |  | — |

| 227 | build | Go-build path in updateScript wrong after #221 | `updateScript` now builds `-o olcrtc ./cmd/olcrtc` (was `/usr/local/bin/olcrtc .`), matching srv.sh + the `/app` entrypoint so restart picks up the rebuild | — |
| 228 | migration | parity_check.py: rebase onto new upstream srv.sh (YAML-based; virtually all base lines changed) |  | — |
| 229 | parity | OlcrtcURI.encode(): stop emitting %clientID (server YAML has no client_id filter; format removed from upstream URI) |  | — |

| 241 | ux | Brand-name casing inconsistent — pick one | brand = `OlcRTC` for display (added `CFBundleDisplayName`); lowercase `olcrtc` for technical IDs + `Olcrtc` Swift type prefix; renamed `OlcRTCiOSApp`→`OlcrtcApp`; convention documented in CONTRIBUTING | — |
| 242 | features | `MobileCheck()` "Ready in Xms" metric per connection | `TunnelManager.checkReady()` via `MobileCheck` on a free ephemeral port; stopwatch "Ready Xms" overlay on the ping chip (long-press + context menu) | — |
| 243 | architecture | Protocol-agnostic `TunnelEngine` seam for a 2nd protocol | extracted `TunnelEngine` protocol + `OlcrtcEngine` (owns all `Mobile*`); `TunnelManager` is now protocol-agnostic (dropped `import Mobile`), dispatches via `ConnectionDetails.engine`; unblocks the #063 mock-engine testing seam | — |

| 248 | build | App icon — `AppIcon.appiconset` ships with no images | added user's pixel-hand + `olcrtc-ios` wordmark → `AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png` (1024 universal); one-shot generator (`scripts/icon/`) removed once the icon was committed | — |
| 249 | build | Privacy manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) — required for App Store | added `App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`: no tracking, empty tracking-domains/collected-data; required-reason audit found only User Defaults → `CA92.1`; auto-bundled to Resources via the `App` glob, `plutil`-lint clean | — |
| 250 | build | CI: build + test (+ `srv.sh` parity) on a macOS runner | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on push/PR/dispatch (macos-15): parity check → gomobile-build `Mobile.xcframework` (cached by upstream commit) → `xcodegen` → `xcodebuild test` on iPhone 16 sim | — |
| 252 | docs | README publication pass — public framing, screenshots, disclaimer | restructured for a serious-project layout (badges, Features, Screenshots placeholder, Contributing, neutral Disclaimer); corrected stale architecture docs (connect→start→runEngine per #243, ATS/`NWConnection` attribution, test coverage); set `haritos90/olcrtc-ios` links; dropped censorship/RU framing | — |
| 253 | build | `Mobile.xcframework` distribution for public cloners | GitHub Releases channel (vs git-lfs): `release.yml` builds/zips/attaches `Mobile.xcframework.zip` per `v*` tag; `scripts/fetch-framework.sh` one-line-downloads it via `gh`, `scripts/build-framework.sh` is the shared from-source fallback (also used by `ci.yml`); README rewritten download-first | — |
| 255 | build | SwiftLint config + CI lint step | lenient `.swiftlint.yml` (excludes the vendored core + generated framework; disables the house-style-divergent rules — identifier_name/type_name/todo/line_length + length/complexity/param-count/`large_tuple`; `force_cast`/`force_try`→warning) + a parallel `lint` job in `ci.yml` (source-only, installs swiftlint if the runner image lacks it, non-strict so warnings annotate but don't fail). Lenient start; tighten to `--strict` over time | — |
| 256 | reliability | Default Jitsi server: all users point at one public instance (`meet1.arbitr.ru`) | exposed the Jitsi base URL as an editable, pre-filled field in the install sheet (shown for the jitsi carrier) + a "shared public instance — point at your own" footer (en+ru), so users aren't silently funnelled onto one third party; `InstallOptions.jitsiBaseURL` (defaults to `AppConstants.defaultJitsiBaseURL`, never sent empty) → `SSHRunner` sends the user's value as `OLCRTC_JITSI_URL`; `srv.sh` untouched (still reads the var; its `:-` default stays the server-side fallback), parity tests green | — |
| 258 | ux | UI redesign — adopt unified design system across all screens | builds 212–216: `App/UI/Theme.swift` + `DesignSystem.swift` (8 components + OlcStatusDot/FlowLayout/OlcEmptyState, dark previews); ServersView (single-source `HostDisplay` model — kills the VPS status-jump), ConnectionsView, all sheets, LogsView, SettingsView restyled; app forced dark via `UIUserInterfaceStyle=Dark`. One button system / one overflow menu / one status vocabulary / one large-title header. Follow-ups split out: #259 (state-machine tests), #261–267 (polish/architecture) | — |
| 259 | tests | Tests for the VPS `HostDisplay` state machine (#258) | extracted the #258 transition rules into a pure reducer on `HostBase`/`HostDisplay` (`seed`/`start`/`advanced`/`terminalBase`/`failed`/`retryBase`) that `ServersView` now drives; `Tests/HostDisplayTests.swift` (16 tests → 182 total) covers readiness→base mapping, op `target`/`phases`, no-optimistic-base-while-running, monotonic+capped phases, probe-authoritative terminal assignment, and failure→Retry `previousBase` restore. Reducer still lives in ServersView.swift → moving it to Models is #263 | — |
| 260 | reliability | Integrate upstream olcrtc (587c13e → e2c4b1e) | bumped submodule pin (jitsi reconnect #82/#88/#89, vp8channel byte-rate pacer, videochannel ffmpeg→`gocodec`; nested `gr` submodule removed — now a go.mod dep `gr v0.1.5`); rebuilt `Mobile.xcframework` via `build-framework.sh` (Mobile* API unchanged → engine compiles), `parity_check.py` clean (srv.sh unchanged), app builds + 182 tests green. No doc churn — our docs never named the `gr` submodule and `--recursive` stays valid. Hijacked doc commit only touches upstream `readme.md`/`westand.svg`, not propagated. PENDING USER: on-device jitsi+vp8 smoke-test; commit+push the pin bump; cut a new `v*` tag so `release.yml` republishes the framework | — |
| 261 | l10n | Promote ServersView hardcoded status/phase strings to L10n | localized the design-system VPS status text — `HostBase.title`/`.subtitle`, `HostOp.verb`, the «Connecting…» initial note, «Check server», «Working…» and the «%@ failed» title — via 24 new `vps*` keys (en+ru). Replaced the never-displayed `HostOp.phases` arrays with `stepCount` (running subtitle = the live localized provisioner message; only the bar denominator is needed); updated the reducer + HostDisplayTests. Metric labels (Ping/Disk/RAM/Uptime) left as-is (not status/phase) | — |
| 262 | architecture | Shared sheet scaffolding + dedupe card-row helper | extracted `.olcSheet(confirm:icon:disabled:onConfirm:)` (an `OlcSheetChrome` ViewModifier — ✕ close + full-width primary footer) into DesignSystem; adopted by AddConnection/AddServerHost/Install/Reconfigure (AddServerHost keeps its keyboard toolbar). Promoted `olcCardRow()` into DesignSystem; removed the private copy in ConnectionsView and the 3 inlined modifier-stacks in ServersView | — |
| 263 | architecture | Move `HostBase`/`HostOp`/`HostDisplay` out of ServersView into App/Models | moved the 3 enums + the pure reducer into `App/Models/HostDisplay.swift` (behavior-preserving; ServersView 965→796 lines; 182 tests green) | — |
| 264 | ux | Restore the IP "last checked" timestamp in the Diagnostics card | re-added `ipCheckTime` (set after `checkAll`), shown as a clock + `HH:MM` caption under the IP result; no L10n needed (icon + localized time) | — |
| 265 | ux | AddConnectionView — manual URI entry | added a 1–3-line monospaced `TextField` (literal `olcrtc://…` placeholder) under the Scan/Paste buttons that auto-parses into the fields on change; restores typing / paste-and-edit that the redesign had dropped | — |
| 266 | l10n | Remove L10n keys orphaned by the redesign | removed 19 unused keys (uriPlaceholder, parseURIAction, typeField, ipLastCheck_fmt, speedTestTitle, statusUnreachable, connectionLine_fmt, alertPasswordMissingDetail, status{Running,Done,Error}Title, actionDisconnect/Ping/Status, sectionInfo, installResultSuccessNotice, rebootingInProgress, scanContainerRow_fmt, uninstallConnectionAlsoRemoved_fmt) from the enum + both dicts; verified zero code refs; L10nTests per-locale count stays balanced | — |
| 267 | ux | Runtime design-direction toggle (Refined/Console) in Settings | `SettingsStore.designConsole` (persisted @Published) drives the 6 direction-dependent Theme tokens (now `static var`: bg/card/segActive + control/card radii + card border); Settings «Theme» picker (Refined/Console); app reskins live via MainTabView's SettingsStore observation. Added L10n themeLabel/themeRefined/themeConsole | — |
| 268 | ux | Manage VPS card shows free disk as if used | disk `awk` field `$4` (Available/free) → `$3` (Used) in `SSHRunner.readinessScript` so the card shows `used/total`, consistent with the RAM line right below it; pure Swift, no `srv.sh`/parity impact | — |
| 269 | reliability | Reconnect on network-path change (`NWPathMonitor`) — Wi-Fi↔cellular handoff | always-on `NWPathMonitor` on `TunnelManager` (lazy-started first connect, never torn down); new `.waitingForNetwork` holding state — hero shows «Waiting for network…», global toggle stays on+enabled (flip off to give up); pure `nonisolated static pathDecision` maps loss→hold, regain→`reconnect(.restored)`, Wi-Fi↔cellular swap→`reconnect(.interfaceChanged)`, debounced 1.5 s and coalesced; `.disconnected`/`.failed` (down server ≠ path problem) + first-update baseline ignored; `bgKeeper` kept running while waiting so a backgrounded app self-recovers; reconnect funnels through `scheduleNetworkReconnect`→`start()` (the seam #270's backoff sink will absorb, #271 the room-settle, #272 the generation guard); `Tests/NetworkPathDecisionTests.swift` (14-case matrix) + `.waitingForNetwork` round-trip | — |
| 270 | reliability | Bounded exponential-backoff auto-reconnect (replace the one-shot retry) | replaced one-shot `scheduleAutoRetry` with `requestReconnect` — a single recovery sink both keep-alive loss and #269 (network regain/interface swap) feed; capped exponential backoff `backoffDelaySeconds` (2→4→8→16→32→60 s, base·2ⁿ clamped) over `maxReconnectAttempts`=6, then terminal `.failed` («tap Retry»), preserving the deliberate battery cap; idempotent (one loop at a time), a verified connect ends the loop so backoff resets, a network loss cancels it (resets on the round-trip), a manual connect/disconnect supersedes it; extracted `preflight` shared by fire-and-forget `start` + awaitable `connectAndAwait`, `runEngine` now returns `Bool` so the loop sees the *verified* outcome; `Tests/ReconnectBackoffTests.swift` (schedule + cap + overflow/negative guards); removed orphaned `autoReconnect_fmt`, added `reconnectAttempt_fmt`/`reconnectGaveUp` (en+ru) | — |
| 271 | reliability | Settle delay before reconnecting into the same room (ghost MUC presence) | carrier-aware room-settle on the auto-reconnect path: `EngineStartSettings.isReconnect` (true only via #270's `connectAndAwait`, false on user `start`) → `OlcrtcEngine.start` waits `rejoinSettleMs(carrier:)` after its `MobileStop()` before re-joining, so the prior session's MUC `presence-unavailable` clears first (jitsi/telemost 3 s, others 1.5 s — XMPP-MUC propagation lag, per the upstream `server.go` ghost-participant note); logged via `rejoinSettle_fmt` (en+ru); fresh connects skip it; `Tests/RejoinSettleTests.swift` pins the mapping + case-insensitivity | — |
| 272 | reliability | Epoch/generation guard in TunnelManager (discard superseded connect/retry results) | monotonic `connectEpoch` bumped in `preflight` per attempt + captured into each detached `runEngine`; new `isLiveAttempt(epoch)` (epoch matches **and** `state == .connecting`) replaces the bare `state == .connecting` guard at all four `runEngine` MainActor hops, so a fast disconnect→reconnect can't alias the new attempt's `.connecting` and post a result for the wrong session; `connectEpoch` is `private(set)` (test-observable); +2 tests (epoch advances per launched attempt; invalid connect consumes none) | — |
| 273 | features | Release the "Direct" routing mode (`.allDirect`) | added `RoutingMode.allDirect` (case + `routingAllDirect` L10n en+ru) so the routing segmented control is a real 2-option choice instead of one pointless item; `ConnectionsView.currentMode` honours it (`.allDirect ? .direct : connected ? .tunnel : .direct`), so the app's own IP-check / speed-test / in-app `SOCKSSession` bypass the tunnel even while connected (a diagnostics kill switch — external apps on the SOCKS port are unaffected, the documented scope); persists via the existing `@AppStorage("olcrtc_routing_mode")`; `Tests/RoutingModeTests.swift` pins raw-value stability (persisted) + distinct non-empty titles | — |
| 274 | ux | Unify the two per-connection probes into one Health check | replaced the dual ping (#234) / time-to-ready (#242) chip — which alternated in one slot via a long-press overlay — with a single **Health check** action (overflow item + chip): one tap runs both isolated probes and logs one combined line `🩺 Health %@ — ready %@ · RTT %@` (`healthResult_fmt`, en+ru); the chip shows RTT (familiar latency pill), or the ready time in amber if only RTT failed, or a red marker if both failed. Underlying `TunnelManager.ping`/`checkReady` + engine unchanged — only the row UI collapsed. Removed 6 now-unused L10n keys (ping/checkReady result/failed/a11y) | — |
| 275 | reliability | "Container running" ≠ "connection healthy" — diagnose connect timeouts | a `MobileWaitReady` timeout means the WebRTC transport never readied — no peer rendezvoused in the room ("Link connected" with no "session opened"). The state used to show the bare Go reason ("Timeout"); `TunnelEngine` now keeps that in the log but surfaces a diagnostic, `connectNoPeer` (en+ru): "No peer joined in time — check the key matches the server, the room is correct, or try another carrier/transport." Also reworded `vpsSubRunning` so the VPS "running" pill no longer reads as "connected" ("Server process up — not a connection test" / «Серверный процесс запущен — это не проверка подключения»). Distinct from #282's verify-failure path | — |
| 276 | observability | Logs: one merged stream + per-entry source tag + level colour-coding | merged the per-category tabs into one chronological stream — `LogEntry` now carries its `category` + an inferred `LogLineLevel` (debug/info/warn/error) + a monotonic `seq`; `LogStore.merged` flattens every category sorted by (date, seq); LogsView renders a single attributed `Text` (one layout region — keeps it cheap) with each line tagged `[Source]` and colour-coded by level (error red / warn orange / info secondary / debug dim), plus a single-select **source filter** (All + per-category) that replaces the tabs; `classify()` infers severity (pion noise→debug first, then ✗/⚠ emoji prefixes, then keyword fallback) and IP-check lines finally carry a source tag; `Tests/LogStoreMergedTests.swift` | — |
| 277 | observability | Logs: dated timestamps + consistent newest-first order + retained scroll | `LogStore.format(date:)`/`timestamp()` now emit `yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss.SSS` (was time-only `HH:mm:ss.SSS`); the in-memory `LogEntry` carries the timestamp as a real `Date` (on-disk lines still self-describe with the inline stamp); the merged stream renders **newest-first** and no longer force-scrolls to the bottom on every append (kills the snap-back to old entries), so the view opens on the freshest line and stays where the user scrolled | — |
| 278 | observability | Server context-menu "Logs" → "Download container logs" + in-tab load/refresh | renamed the server-card context-menu `actionLogs` → `actionDownloadContainerLogs` ("Download container logs" / «Скачать логи контейнера») with an `arrow.down.doc` icon; `Provisioner.containerLogs` now parses each line's Go timestamp (`yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss`, carry-forward for continuation lines) so container output interleaves chronologically with the client stream instead of clustering at fetch-time, and records the host/container via `LogStore.noteContainerTarget`; the Logs tab gains a **"Refresh from server"** button (`logsRefreshFromServer`) that re-pulls that target directly (no trip back to the server card); `parseExternalTimestamp` also tolerates our own format so re-ingesting is a no-op | — |
| 280 | performance | Fix UI jank when changing font size while scrolling | the font-size `Slider` committed `settings.fontSizeIndex` on **every drag tick**, and that value drives `.dynamicTypeSize` app-wide (a full view-tree relayout) + a UserDefaults write — the stutter. Now the drag updates a local `@State fontDragIndex` only (re-rendering just the Settings row + a live preview); the app-wide value commits **once on release** via `onEditingChanged`. The preview text scales live through a scoped `.dynamicTypeSize`. (The Logs list, the worst offender, is already a single attributed `Text` after #276.) | — |
| 281 | ux | Make the Refined/Console design directions actually distinct | amplified the Console tokens from near-identical (±2pt radius / 0.5pt border) into a clearly sharper, denser terminal direction: tighter radii (card 7 vs 20, control 5 vs 13, segmented 5 vs 10), a *visible* hairline card border (1pt @ white 16%, was 0.5pt @ 8% — invisible), denser spacing (card padding 12 vs 16, section gap 14 vs 22), and monospaced caption/section labels. Refined stays soft + borderless. `Tests/ThemeDirectionTests.swift` pins them as distinct | — |
| 282 | l10n | `serverNotResponding`: reword to name the carrier server (not the VPS) + RU | reworded the carrier-failure state messages so they no longer read as the user's VPS: `serverNotResponding` → "Conferencing server not responding" / «Сервер видеосвязи не отвечает» (verify-failed path), `serverConnectionLost` → "Connection to the conferencing server lost" / «Связь с сервером видеосвязи потеряна» (keep-alive-loss path). The "RU shows English" was a build-221 artifact — both RU values already shipped on current builds; this is the wording fix. L10n-string-only (no keys / Swift touched) → no bump/build | — |
| 283 | l10n | Localisation gaps: "Servers" group + carrier/transport display names | (a) the canonical default group token "Servers" now renders via `ConnectionRecord.displayGroupName` → `L10n.groupDefault` at display time (RU «Основная») with no record migration; AddConnectionView stores the canonical token when the field is left at the localised default. (b) the carrier/transport pickers + matrix showed raw IDs — added `CarrierTransportMatrix.carrierLabel`/`transportLabel` (7 L10n keys, en+ru; "telemost"→«Телемост») wired into all three pickers + the matrix rows (selection value stays the raw ID). Documented the explicit-entry convention in CONTRIBUTING. Logs tabs/header were already covered by #276/#278. `Tests/DisplayNameTests.swift` | — |
| 284 | parity | Update the carrier×transport compatibility matrix data | re-derived every cell from the upstream authoritative table (`olcrtc-upstream/docs/settings.md`, from the E2E suite): telemost+datachannel `.ok`→`.fail` (DataChannel removed from Telemost), telemost+seichannel `.unknown`→`.fail` (unsupported), telemost+videochannel and wbstream sei/video `.unknown`→`.ok`, wbstream+datachannel `.fail`→`.question` (guest tokens canPublishData=false), and promoted the per-carrier recommended cells to match `defaultTransport` (jitsi+datachannel, telemost/wbstream+vp8channel). `Tests/CarrierTransportMatrixTests.swift` pins the key cells | — |
| 285 | reliability | Speed test over the tunnel: degrade gracefully + selectable providers + connection-type | the test "never worked on the tunnel" because vp8channel is a <1 Mbps covert pipe (raw VPS 775/318 vs ~0.77/0.51 through it), not a broken test. On `.tunnel` the run now degrades: serial (not parallel) measurements, scaled-down payloads (1 MB/512 KB vs 5 MB/2 MB) + longer timeouts, ping failure tolerated (reports "n/a"), partial results kept. Header logs the connection type (direct/tunnel + carrier/transport). Provider is selectable in Settings (`SpeedTestProvider`: Cloudflare parametric down/up/trace + OVH fixed-file download/HEAD, both verified) persisted in `speedTestProviderID`. On a slow video-transport tunnel it hints toward Reconfigure → datachannel. `Tests/SpeedTestProviderTests.swift` | — |
| 288 | build | CI: skip the build/test + lint jobs on docs-only pushes | `ci.yml` `push`/`pull_request` now carry `paths-ignore: **/*.md, docs/**, LICENSE`, so a docs-only commit (a TODO/README/catalog edit) skips the whole run (gomobile build + xcodebuild test + SwiftLint); any `.swift` / `project.yml` / `scripts/**` / workflow change still runs. `release.yml` is tag-triggered and untouched. Caveat: if CI ever becomes a *required* branch-protection check, `paths-ignore` leaves it pending on skipped runs — switch to a path-filter gate job that reports success instead | — |
| 286 | ux | IP-check: selectable providers (10, incl. RU/ru-zone) + connection-type | grew `AppConstants.ipCheckServices` to a curated **10** (7 international + 3 RU/ru-zone — `2ip.ru`, `2ip.io`, `ip.beget.ru`, all verified to return a bare IP over HTTPS with a curl UA, 2026-06; JSON-only endpoints dropped). The user toggles which to query via **checkboxes in Settings** (`SettingsStore.enabledIPSources`, persisted as an array, keyed by label), with a default subset (3 intl + 1 RU) and an empty-set fallback so the check never queries nothing. IP-check header now logs `→ IP check (Direct/Via tunnel) — N source(s)` (connection-type was already there). `Tests/IPCheckSourcesTests.swift` | — |
| 287 | observability | Log-line cleanups from the real capture | three fixes, two extracted as pure testable helpers: (1) keep-alive "active −N s ago" went negative because `noteActivity(forAtLeast:)` parks the marker ahead → `TunnelManager.keepAliveSkipNote(ageSeconds:)` reports "tunnel busy (Ns reserved)" for the future-marker case; (2) tunnel-verify "bad URL" (a valid URL whose SOCKS session can't be built mid-teardown) → `verifyFailureReason(_:)` maps `URLError.badURL/.unsupportedURL` to "proxy not ready"; (3) the port check-result line now routes through single keys `logPortFree_fmt`/`logPortBusy_fmt` (en+ru) instead of assembling fragments. `Tests/LogLineCleanupTests.swift` | — |
| 289 | performance | Logs tab: visibility gate — rebuild the merged stream only when on-screen | `LogsView.refreshCache()` (sort all categories + rebuild the `AttributedString`) ran on every `LogStore.revision` bump — once per log line — and `TabView` keeps off-screen tabs alive, so it churned in the background during a log storm on another tab. Added `TabView(selection:)` + `.tag`s in App.swift and pass `isActive: selectedTab == 2` into `LogsView`; the per-line rebuild is gated on `isActive`, with a one-shot catch-up `onChange(of: isActive)` when the tab is shown. Eliminates all off-tab rebuild work. On-tab burst smoothing (debounce) is the follow-up #290 | — |
| 290 | performance | Logs: debounce/coalesce the on-tab merged-stream rebuild during log storms | Won't Do — superseded by #294 (logs revert to per-source tabs; no merged stream left to debounce) | — |
| 291 | reliability | Speed test: OVH measures no upload + result units (Mbps/ms) no longer shown | (a) upload: a fixed-file provider (OVH) has no `/__up` sink, so UL showed nothing — `AppConstants.SpeedTest.uploadProvider(for:)` now routes the upload leg to the Cloudflare parametric `/__up` fallback when the selected provider can't upload (logged), so UL is measured instead of blank; (b) units: DL/UL lost their `Mbps` suffix in the redesign — restored next to the numbers (Ping already showed `ms`), matching this view's hardcoded-unit convention. `Tests/SpeedTestProviderTests.swift` (+2 fallback-resolution tests) | — |
| 293 | ux | Settings: move IP-check source selection into its own sub-screen | the inline #286 checkboxes now sit behind a navigation row ("IP check sources" + a selected-count) in the main Settings list; the toggle list moved to a dedicated `IPSourcesSettingsView` sub-screen. Model unchanged (`SettingsStore.enabledIPSources` + default subset + empty-set fallback) | — |
| 298 | ux | Settings: keep scroll position stable on font-size change (don't jump) | wrapped the Settings `Form` in a `ScrollViewReader` and tagged the Font row with a stable id; on `fontSizeIndex` commit (the app-wide dynamic-type relayout that moved the viewport) it `scrollTo`s that anchor (`.center`), so the Font control stays put instead of the list jumping | — |
| 292 | features | Speed test: add Hetzner provider (Yandex researched, no usable endpoint) | added Hetzner (`ash-speed.hetzner.com/100MB.bin`, fixed-file, no upload → falls back to Cloudflare per #291) to `AppConstants.SpeedTest.providers`; researched Yandex + several other RU/regional mirrors but found no stable small-file (1-10 MB) HTTPS endpoint suitable for the existing whole-file download path — documented in code comments. `Tests/SpeedTestProviderTests.swift` +2 | Speed test: new Hetzner server option (ash-speed.hetzner.com) |
| 294 | observability | Logs: revert merged stream → per-source tabs (Connection/Diagnostics/VPS/Container) | `LogsView` rewritten as a `TabView` with 4 tabs (Connection/Diagnostics/VPS via `LogCategoryTabView`, Container via `ContainerLogsTabView`); shared `LogRendering` (filter/newest-first/colour/plain export, `@MainActor`) + `LogTabHeader` (description + file name). `LogCategory.ip`/`.speed` → `.diagnostics` (`diagnostics.log`). Removed the `merged` stream and the #289 visibility-gate plumbing — `isActive` kept on `LogsView.init` for call-site compatibility but unused. Supersedes #290 (Won't Do). New L10n: `categoryDiagnostics`, `logsTabDesc*`, `logsFileNameLabel_fmt` (en+ru) | Logs tab redesigned: separate Connection / Diagnostics / VPS / Container views, each showing its description and log file name |
| 295 | observability | Logs: per-server container log files with a unique server-name prefix | `LogStore` gained per-server container buffers/files keyed by `ServerHost.logFilePrefix` (new `sanitizeLogFilePrefix`: alphanumerics kept, rest collapse to `_`, falls back to `"server"`); `startContainerSession`/`logContainer`/`clearContainer`/`noteContainerTarget` all take `serverPrefix`. `Provisioning.containerLogs` writes through the per-host prefix. `AddServerHostView` rejects duplicate names/prefixes (`isDuplicateLabel`, new `duplicateServerNameError` L10n). `Tests/ServerHostTests.swift` (new) | Each server now keeps its own container log file |
| 296 | ux | Container logs: always-present "Download from server" button + empty hint | `ContainerLogsTabView` (part of #294's `LogsView` rewrite) has a server picker (when >1 host) and an always-present "Download logs from server" / "Check server" (when offline) button, plus an empty-state hint that logs need loading from the server. New L10n: `logsDownloadFromServer`, `logsCheckServer`, `logsContainerEmptyHint`, `logsContainerSelectServer`, `logsContainerNoServers` (en+ru) | Container logs: "Download from server" is always available (or "Check server" while offline) |
| 297 | reliability | Fix freeze when opening Container logs for a server not yet checked | `ContainerLogsTabView.primaryAction` (#296) called `probeReadiness(containerName: nil)`, but `parseReadiness` always returns `.imageReady` for `containerName == nil` — "Check server" could never discover/adopt a container, a silent dead end that read as a frozen button. Now mirrors #302: scans for an existing `olcrtc-server-*` via `scanContainers` and adopts the first match. Every remaining dead end (missing password, no container found, fetch error) sets a visible alert instead of returning silently | Container logs: "Check server" now finds and adopts an existing container, and shows an error instead of doing nothing |
| 300 | ux | Port check: 3 states (free / used by another / used by olcrtc tunnel) | `PortAvailability.PortState` (`.free`/`.busyOther`/`.busyOurs`) gated on live `TunnelManager` state via `tunnelHoldsPort`, replacing the binary `isFree` heuristic in `SettingsView`'s port check; new `logPortBusyOther_fmt`/`logPortBusyOlcrtc_fmt` + relabeled `portInUseByOlcrtc` (en+ru). `Tests/PortAvailabilityTests.swift` +4. Follow-up: #313 | Port check now distinguishes free / busy by another app / in use by the olcrtc tunnel |
| 301 | features | New "Config" tab between Manage VPS and Logs (placeholder "Coming soon") | new `ConfigView` (NavigationStack + `OlcEmptyState` "Coming soon") inserted at tab index 2; Logs/Settings shifted to tags 3/4 and the Logs visibility gate updated to `selectedTab == 3`. New L10n `tabConfig` + placeholder strings (en+ru) | — |
| 302 | reliability | Server check: auto-detect existing olcrtc containers (no false "cached for reinstall") | `checkServer` now, when the readiness probe finds no *known* container on a host with `lastContainerName == nil`, folds in `scanContainers` and adopts the first `olcrtc-server-*` found — persists its name, sets the base to running/stopped from its status, logs `autoDetectedContainer` — so an existing container surfaces without the separate "Look for olcrtc containers" tap (still available for multi-container hosts) | — |
| 304 | ux | Move "Share connection" from Connections to the Manage VPS tab | extracted the share sheet into a reusable `ShareConnectionView` (QR now a `NavigationLink` push, not a second-sheet handoff) and moved the "Share connection" action onto the server card (shown when the host has a linked `ConnectionRecord`). Removed it (and its `shareConn`/`pendingQRConn` plumbing) from the Connections row menu; Copy URI / QR remain there as quick utilities | — |
| 305 | build | Release notes: auto-append tasks closed between releases (ID + title + resolution) | new `scripts/closed-tasks-since.py` diffs TODO.md's Closed table between `--since <tag>` and the working tree → markdown bullets `- #ID title — resolution`; `release.yml` runs it for `$PREV` and appends a "Tasks closed since <tag>" section to the notes (omitted on the first release / when empty / when the script is absent at an old tag) | — |
| 306 | build | Release assets order: `.ipa` before `Mobile.xcframework` | `release.yml`: build the unsigned `.ipa` before creating the release and make it the create asset, then attach `Mobile.xcframework.zip` in a follow-up upload — GitHub orders assets by upload time, so the user-facing sideload artifact now leads. Asset footer in the notes reordered to match | — |
| 307 | build | Per-version download counter for Release assets (GitHub API `download_count`) | new `scripts/download-stats.py` (stdlib-only) sums `release.assets[].download_count` per tag → markdown table (per-asset + per-tag + all-time total); repo from `--repo`/`$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`/git origin, token from `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` (one paginated `GET /releases`, within the unauth rate limit). New `download-stats.yml` workflow regenerates `docs/download-stats.md` weekly (+ manual) and commits only on change (`[skip ci]`). Surfaced via a README total-downloads shields badge + a link from the sideload section | — |
| 308 | reliability | SOCKS port: always bind the configured port (no auto-slide — breaks Shadowrocket etc.); busy → clear "port busy" error, don't connect | removed `PortAvailability.nextFreePort`/`autoRetryAttempts` (the auto-slide, reversing #108/#148); (a) `reservePortAndSettings` now does a single `isFree(configuredPort)` check → typed `.failed` before the engine starts; (b) `OlcrtcEngine.startErrorReason(_:port:)` maps a late gomobile bind race (`address already in use`) to the same reason; (c) new `errorPortBusy_fmt` L10n (en+ru) names the busy port, dropping `portChangedAuto_fmt`/`errorAllPortsBusy_fmt`; (d) catalog row OLC-1026 (E). `freeEphemeralPort` kept for probes. `Tests/PortAvailabilityTests.swift` (−3 slide tests, +2 error-mapping tests) | — |
| 303 | features | Recover/add a connection from server access when Connections is empty (import or generate) | added "Recover connection" host action (shown when a container is found but `lastConnectionID == nil`): `SSHRunner.recoverConfig`/`recoverConfigScript` read-only `cat` the deployed `server.yaml` + `~/.olcrtc_key`, `parseRecoveredConfig` rebuilds carrier/transport/room/key (+ vp8/sei tuning), `ServersView.recoverConnection` adds the resulting `ConnectionRecord` and links `lastConnectionID`. Import-from-existing only — "generate new key" fallback tracked as #314 | New "Recover connection" action rebuilds a connection from an already-installed server |
| 309 | build | download-stats: timestamp defeats the commit-on-change guard | `download-stats.py` now strips the `Last updated:` line before comparing the freshly-built doc to the existing file; if only the timestamp differs, the old file (with its old timestamp) is kept so the weekly workflow's `git diff --quiet` guard stays meaningful | Weekly download-stats workflow no longer commits when nothing changed |
| 310 | build | closed-tasks-since.py: `\d{3}` row regex silently drops task IDs ≥ #1000 | `ROW` regex `\d{3}` → `\d+` (header/separator/placeholder rows still excluded); `new_ids` now sorted with `key=int`; TODO.md header reworded "permanent 3-digit ID" → "permanent numeric ID" | Release-notes tooling now handles task IDs beyond #999 |
| 311 | l10n | Route speed-tile metric labels/units + upload-fallback log line through L10n | `ConnectionsView.speedRow` labels (Ping/DL/UL) and `"%.0f ms"`/`"%.1f Mbps"` formats, plus `SpeedTest.measureUpload`'s fallback log line, now go through new `speedLabelPing/DL/UL`, `speedPingValue_fmt`, `speedRateValue_fmt`, `speedUploadFallback_fmt` (en+ru, ru=en — universal abbreviations / deliberately-English diagnostic line) | Speed tile labels and units are now localizable |
| 312 | docs | README testing section drifted ("238 unit tests" + stale "port selection") | dropped the exact test count for "A broad suite of unit tests covers…"; replaced "port selection" with "port availability / busy-error mapping" (#308) | README: testing section brought up to date |
| 315 | build | Closed table: Release note column for curated GitHub Release notes | new 5th Closed column **Release note** (one user-facing "what's new" line, filled on close; `—` = fall back to title); `closed-tasks-since.py` emits `- #ID note` instead of `- #ID title — resolution` (5-col regex + 4-col fallback for historic refs); all 294 prior rows backfilled with `—`; documented in TODO.md header, AGENTS.md §5, CONTRIBUTING.md → Task tracking | Release notes now show short "what's new" lines instead of verbose task resolutions |
| 316 | ux | LogsView (#294) nests a `TabView` inside MainTabView's `TabView` — verify rendering; likely replace with `OlcSegmented` (the pre-#276 pattern) | rebuilt as a single `NavigationStack` (design_handoff_logs_theme §1): `OlcSegmented` category switch (short labels Conn/Diag/VPS/Container, full names via `accessibilityLabel`), ONE `.searchable` + ONE overflow menu, one file-header row (`doc.text` + monospaced file name + line count) attached to the log body; deleted the nested `TabView`, per-tab `NavigationStack`s, `LogTabHeader` (its description now opens the empty-state hint) and the unused `isActive` plumbing (App.swift call site included); per-server container picker/fetch (#295–#297) carried over unchanged | Logs tab redesigned: no more second tab bar — one header, a compact category switch, and a single file row with line count |
| 318 | observability | Orphaned log files after #294/#295 linger in Documents/logs | `LogStore.init` now calls `cleanupOrphanedLogFiles()`, deleting `ip.log`/`speed.log` (merged into `diagnostics.log` by #294) and the old shared `containerLogs.log` (replaced by per-server files in #295), once per launch | — |
| 319 | reliability | Integrate upstream olcrtc (e2c4b1e → 39cc3fa) | bumped submodule pin (13 commits): server.go `reinstallSession` now closes the old muxconn before the session swap (fixes "frame too large" when a client reconnects faster than the server can push new-session frames into the dying smux session); jitsi engine hardening — `RequireTargetedPeer` drops untargeted broadcast frames before the peer-latch (already wired via `internal/client`, no mobile.go API change), bounded 30s rejoin-join timeout, RTCP keepalive only runs when a PC carries media/SCTP bridge, `PeerConnectionStateFailed` now triggers a reconnect instead of `onEnded`; muxconn/smux retuning (`inboundQueue` 256→128, `fastSpinAttempts` 200→16, `MaxStreamBuffer` 1MiB→512KiB, frames up to 32KiB); vp8channel default fps 60→30 + smaller KCP queues (CPU-reduction pass). Default Jitsi server list changed (`meet.cryptopro.ru` removed, `meet.small-dm.ru`/`meet.handyweb.org` added) — our `AppConstants.defaultJitsiBaseURL` (`meet1.arbitr.ru`) is unaffected, still in the list. `parity_check.py` clean — the upstream interactive Jitsi-menu/room-options rewrite in `script/srv.sh` falls entirely outside our non-interactive boc patches. Rebuilt `Mobile.xcframework` via `build-framework.sh` (Mobile* API unchanged), app builds + 265 tests green. Follow-up: #320 (re-benchmark our 60fps vp8/sei srv.sh defaults against upstream's new 30fps recommendation) | Reconnects after a dropped session are more reliable |
| 322 | build | Commit `bf48a75` message ("upstream parity update") is not Conventional Commits and omits the #297/#318 work — amend before push | amended before push | — |
| 326 | l10n | Connections tab: default group header says "Servers" — rename to "Connections"; "servers" wording stays Manage-VPS-only | Duplicate — implemented as #344 in the build-248 commit (en "Connections", ru "Подключения"; stored `defaultGroupName` token unchanged per #283) | — |
| 338 | ux | Logs: inline container fetch with progress (design_handoff_logs_theme §2) | Container source card in LogsView: host chips ≤3 (primary connection's host first, ★; `Menu` picker beyond 3) + secondary "Fetch"/"Check server" `OlcButton` with `isBusy`; monotonic 3-phase progress (Connecting… → `podman logs --tail N <name>` → Receiving output…) with k/n + new shared `OlcProgressBar(fraction:)` (also replaces the Manage VPS card's `ProgressView`); `Provisioner.containerLogs` emits the third phase signal and writes a `── podman logs --tail N · HH:mm ──` divider (`.debug`/tertiary) via `startContainerSession(divider:)` instead of the generic "── new session ──"; empty buffer → `OlcEmptyState` with primary "Fetch from {host}" CTA; scan-first fallback (#296/#297 alert) kept; removed orphaned `logsDownloadFromServer` key | Container logs now fetch right inside the Logs tab with live phase progress and a session divider |
| 339 | ux | Logs: delete the container-logs popup; Manage VPS routes to the Logs tab (design_handoff_logs_theme §3) | deleted `ContainerLogsView.swift` + `ContainerLogsPayload` + ServersView's `logsPayload`/`.sheet`/`fetchLogs`; new `LogsRouter` (`@Published request: (hostID, autofetch)?`) owned by App.swift — ServersView's renamed "Container logs" item writes a request, MainTabView switches to the Logs tab, LogsView consumes it (Container category + host + auto-fetch via #338's phase UI, idempotent, skipped if a fetch is running); removed orphaned `emptyLogsTitle`/`emptyLogsHint_fmt`, `actionDownloadContainerLogs` → `actionContainerLogs` ("Container logs"); no SSH/Provisioner logic changes (stale doc comment fixed) | "Container logs" on a VPS card now opens the Logs tab and fetches right there — no more popup |
| 340 | ux | Light/Dark theme with System/Light/Dark picker (design_handoff_logs_theme §4) | persisted `AppearanceMode` (system/light/dark, **default dark** so existing users see no change) in SettingsStore; "Appearance" picker above the Refined/Console picker; `.preferredColorScheme` on the root in App.swift; removed `UIUserInterfaceStyle: Dark` from project.yml (it would override the modifier); Theme.swift `bg`/`segActive`/Console `card` + new `cardBorder` token now dynamic via `UIColor` trait closures per the handoff token table (Console light values applied mechanically — no further Console design work per operator decision; #299 stays open for the full Refined/Console replacement); audit found one hardcoded surface (OlcCard hairline `Color.white.opacity(0.16)` → `Theme.Palette.cardBorder`); light `#Preview`s added for the component set + all five tabs; CLAUDE.md dark-only invariant rewritten | New Appearance setting: System, Light, or Dark theme (default stays dark) |
| 341 | ux | Manage VPS card: fixed footprint + icon actions + compact metrics (design_handoff_logs_theme §5) | status region in a `minHeight: 58` container (pill / pill+bar / failed pill crossfade, no height change); metrics strip ALWAYS rendered — new one-line `OlcMiniStat` strip `PING 27ms · DISK 36/40G · RAM 241/2048M · UP 11d` ("—" placeholders, `.opacity(0.45)` during ops) replacing the conditional two-deck `OlcMetric` row; action bar = contextual primary + three 44×44 tinted `OlcIconButton`s (Check accent / Container logs green → #339 route / Reconfigure orange), logs+reconfigure disabled without a container, all disabled during ops, still a strict subset of `hostMenu`; `OlcMiniStat(label:value:tone:)` + `OlcIconButton(systemImage:tint:)` added to DesignSystem.swift; compact formatters `shortUsage`/`shortUptime` pinned by new `VPSStatFormattingTests` (269 tests) | VPS cards keep one fixed size in every state, with compact one-line metrics and three tinted quick-action buttons |
| 342 | ux | Connections: fixed-footprint hero + connect progress + speed units (design_handoff_logs_theme §6) | hero restructured: status row · ALWAYS-rendered two-line server line (mono subtitle reserves its line) · always-present hairline · fixed `minHeight: 44` footer slot swapping hint ("Flip the switch to connect via %@") / connecting (mono text + `HeroIndeterminateFill` — single `.connecting` state, asymptotic 90% fill, no fake steps) / waiting-for-network / SOCKS5 line / failure (2-line clamp) + compact 32pt Retry; conditional divider+row appends deleted; `OlcButton` gained `compact:` (32pt, same roles); `OlcMetric` gained `unit:` (smaller secondary text) — speed formats become number-only (`speedPingValue_fmt` "%.0f", `speedRateValue_fmt` "%.1f") with new `speedUnitMs`/`speedUnitMbps`, unit only next to a real number; IP-check block untouched (growth on disagreement by design); no TunnelManager changes | Connections hero keeps one fixed size in every state, shows connect progress, and speed-test numbers carry their units cleanly |
| 343 | ux | Settings regroup + DNS submenu + Appearance last (design_handoff_logs_theme §7) | section order now SOCKS5 (one section: port + Random + check + auth) → DNS → vp8channel → Connection (six sections merged into one) → Diagnostics (IP-sources link + speed provider, picker unchanged per operator decision) → Logs (three merged) → Appearance (language · Theme=System/Light/Dark · Direction=Refined/Console · font slider) → version footer; DNS chip wall → `NavigationLink` summary row ("Yandex · 77.88.8.8:53") + new `DNSSettingsView` subscreen (preset rows: name + mono address + checkmark, long dnsFooter moved there, free-form field + keyboard Done; also kills the MegaFon/Yota duplicate-ForEach-ID the chip wall had); one short footer per section (kept: socksPortChangeNote, footerKeepAlive, speedProviderFooter, footerLogBuffer, fontFooter); relabels: scheme picker "Appearance"→"Theme", Refined/Console "Theme"→new `directionLabel` "Direction", section header "Font"→"Appearance"; removed 10 orphaned L10n keys; every SettingsStore binding kept | Settings reorganized: cleaner sections, DNS picker moved to its own page, appearance options grouped at the bottom |
| 344 | l10n | Connections tab: default list group says "Servers" — rename to "Connections" | `L10n.groupDefault` display value "Servers"→"Connections" (ru "Основная"→"Подключения"); display-only — the persisted raw `ConnectionRecord.defaultGroupName` stays "Servers", mapped via `displayGroupName` (#283), so no migration | The connection list on the Connections tab is now titled "Connections" instead of "Servers" |
| 345 | build | Commit `05b3447` message ("no description yet") is not Conventional Commits — amend before push | amended before push (build-248 commit, `feat(ui): single-stack Logs tab…`). Policy fixed so this task type isn't refiled: a placeholder subject is the expected pre-review state — the local `/review-commits` command now hands the ready-to-run amend command instead of filing a task; the commit-review and batch sections (§7/§8) were removed from public AGENTS.md (operator-local workflow — contributors review their own way) | — |

# TODO

Task ledger for olcrtc-ios. Every task has a permanent 3-digit ID and flows
**Backlog → Open → Closed**. This is the single place work is tracked;
`AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` point here.

## How this file works

**Lifecycle**

1. **New task** → add a row to **Backlog**, and (if the title isn't enough) a
   block under **Details** with the full description.
2. **Work starts** → move the row to **Open**.
3. **Finished** → move the row to **Closed**, fill the **Resolution** column (how
   it was resolved — or `Won't Do` / `Duplicate` for rejected tasks), and
   **delete its Details block**.

A rejected or duplicate task is also closed (Resolution `Won't Do` / `Duplicate`);
there is no separate "won't do" list. Detail blocks exist only for **Open +
Backlog** tasks. Closed tasks are title-only history plus the **Resolution** note —
their full setup descriptions are intentionally not kept.

**Columns**

- **Pri** — `P0` critical (correctness / security / broken) · `P1` high ·
  `P2` medium · `P3` low / nice-to-have.
- **Eff** — `XS` ≤ 15 min · `S` ≤ 1 h · `M` ≤ ½ day · `L` ≤ 2 days · `XL` > 2 days.
- **Theme** — security · reliability · architecture · parity (server↔client wire
  contract) · tests · observability · ux · docs · build · l10n · features ·
  migration · accessibility · performance · settings.

**Sorting** — every table (Open, Backlog, Closed) and the Details blocks are kept
in **ascending ID** order.

**Layout** — Open and Backlog come first, then their **Details** blocks, then the
**Closed** history last, so the active work and its descriptions stay at the top.

**Next free ID:** 274

## Details (Open + Backlog only)

### 097 — SEI/VIDEO env vars end-to-end OR remove

Server reads `OLCRTC_VIDEO_*` and `OLCRTC_SEI_*`; the client never sets them. Either
expose them in `SettingsStore` + `InstallOptionsView` (~14 sliders), or commit to a
"VP8-only client" and drop the dead branches from `scripts/srv.sh`. The UI hint from
#087 buys time but is a placeholder.

### 112 — NetworkExtension packet tunnel

Full-device VPN (route every app, not just SOCKS-aware ones) needs a NetworkExtension
Packet Tunnel provider + the `packet-tunnel-provider` entitlement, which requires a paid
($99/yr) Apple Developer account. The standard pattern — confirmed by olcbox, a 5-platform
olcrtc client — is to keep running the olcrtc core as a local SOCKS5 and bridge TUN↔SOCKS5
with [`hev-socks5-tunnel`](https://github.com/heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel) inside the
`PacketTunnelProvider`. Worth noting even olcbox skipped iOS TUN (its iOS target is
SOCKS5-only — "a Swift shell"), so this is high-effort / low-ROI and gated on the paid
account.

### 115 — TestFlight

Stand up the App Store Connect app record and a TestFlight build for internal
testing. Prerequisites: a real app icon (#248), the privacy manifest (#249), and
signing (set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`). On-device testing over cellular and inside RU
networks is already handled by the maintainer — this task is only the TestFlight
pipeline (archive → upload → internal testers).

### 235 — Failover profiles: multi-carrier iOS install

**BLOCKED on #247.** Server-side failover is supported — `internal/config` parses
`profiles:` / `failover:`, and `cmd/olcrtc/main.go` drives them through
`internal/supervisor` (runs profiles in order; on a session drop it waits
`retry_delay` and advances, up to `max_cycles`). `srv.sh` could emit a multi-profile
`server.yaml`:

```yaml
mode: srv
profiles:
  - name: jitsi-primary
    auth: { provider: jitsi }
    room: { id: "https://meet1.arbitr.ru/myroom" }
  - name: telemost-fallback
    auth: { provider: telemost }
    room: { id: "telemost-room-id" }
failover: { retry_delay: 5s, max_cycles: 3 }
```

The blocker: client and server rendezvous in the **same conferencing room**, and a
profile switch changes carrier *and* room (`config.ApplyProfile`). The bundled
`Mobile.xcframework` is single-session only — `mobile/mobile.go` exposes
`Start`/`StartWithTransport`/`Stop` and imports neither `config` nor `supervisor`, so
the iOS client has no way to follow the server's switch; when the server moves it is
left calling an empty room. A server-only multi-profile install is therefore *worse*
than none on iOS. #247 (failover in the gomobile binding) must land first.

Once unblocked, the iOS work is: `InstallOptions` gains a list of `FailoverProfile`
(carrier + roomID); `InstallOptionsView` gets an "Add fallback carrier" button;
`SSHRunner` generates multi-profile YAML; `ConnectionRecord` represents a
multi-profile connection (which roomID/carrier to show); `TunnelManager` drives the
client failover loop exposed by #247.

### 247 — Failover/profiles in the gomobile binding

Prerequisite for #235. The server cycles failover profiles (`internal/supervisor`,
wired in `cmd/olcrtc/main.go`), but the iOS client binding
(`olcrtc-upstream/mobile/mobile.go`) is single-session and has no way to follow a
carrier/room switch. Expose a profile-aware client entry point — an ordered list of
carrier/room/transport that the client cycles through, mirroring the server's
`retry_delay` / `max_cycles` — or a lighter "reconnect across an ordered carrier list
until the server is found" loop. Needs upstream Go work in `mobile/` (the existing
`supervisor.Runner` is the *server* session runner; a client-side supervisor doesn't
exist yet) plus a `Mobile.xcframework` rebuild. Until this lands, end-to-end failover
on iOS is only achievable via an app-level Swift loop whose client/server convergence
is best-effort (they can sit on different profiles during the detection-skew window).

**Decision (2026-06-04): UPSTREAM-only — do not fork or patch the submodule locally.**
CI (`ci.yml`), `release.yml`, and every cloner's `fetch-framework.sh` build the framework
from the *pinned* upstream commit, so a local edit to `olcrtc-upstream/mobile/mobile.go`
would build on the maintainer's machine but break CI and every clone (the published
framework wouldn't carry the new symbol, and the Swift calling it wouldn't link). The
client entry point — sketch `StartWithProfiles(profilesSpec, clientID, keyHex, socksPort,
socksUser, socksPass, retryDelayMillis, maxCycles)`: cycle an ordered carrier/room/transport
list in the existing singleton slot, reusing `client.RunWithReady` with a per-profile
handshake-timeout advance, mirroring `internal/supervisor`'s `retry_delay`/`max_cycles` —
must therefore land in **upstream** `mobile/mobile.go`. Re-check on each `olcrtc-upstream`
pull (the #260-style integration); **close when upstream ships it**, after which the iOS
side is only an `OlcrtcEngine` wiring + a framework rebuild.

### 254 — CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Adopt the standard Contributor Covenant. The only decision is the enforcement-contact
method (a maintainer email, or "via GitHub private report") to fill the template
placeholder. Community-health hygiene; not blocking the first push.

### 257 — Privacy-policy document

App Store submission requires a privacy-policy URL even when the app collects nothing.
Write a short policy ("no personal data collected or transmitted; the encryption key and
SSH credentials never leave the device / Keychain") and host it (GitHub Pages or a gist),
then link it from App Store Connect and the README. Distinct from the in-bundle privacy
manifest (#249).

### 273 — Release the "Direct" routing mode (`.allDirect`)

`RoutingMode` ships only `.allTunnel` today (`App/Models/RoutingMode.swift`), so the routing
segmented control in ConnectionsView is a pointless single option. Add the planned `.allDirect`
"Direct" mode — a global kill switch that bypasses the tunnel even while the session stays
connected. Wiring: add the case + `title`/L10n; make ConnectionsView's `currentMode` honour it
(`routingMode == .allDirect ? .direct : (connected ? .tunnel : .direct)`) so the app's own
diagnostics (IP check / speed test) and any in-app `SOCKSSession` go direct; persists via the
existing `@AppStorage("olcrtc_routing_mode")`. **Settle first:** scope — `.allDirect` cleanly
controls the *app's own* URLSession routing, but it can't force *external* apps off the local
SOCKS port, so decide whether "Direct" means "app-diagnostics bypass" only or also "tear the
proxy down but keep the config" (a truer kill switch). Mirrors Shadowrocket's global-route
toggle; framing groundwork for the later `.rules` / `.scene` modes noted in `RoutingMode`.

| 185 | reliability | SSHRunner: `fatalError("unreachable")` in `connect()` — replace with `preconditionFailure` to avoid release crashes |  |
| 186 | reliability | Provisioning.reconfigure: returns nil URI silently if server didn't emit OLCRTC_URI — UI shows success but ConnectionRecord not updated; should throw |  |
| 187 | reliability | ConnectionsView: `shareConn = nil; DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter { qrConn = conn }` — race if view dismissed before delay fires; use onDisappear instead |  |
| 188 | ux | ServersView: `foundContainers` not cleared when scan sheet dismissed — old results flash briefly on next scan |  |
| 189 | observability | KeychainHelper: failure logs missing numeric OSStatus code — hard to debug Keychain errors without the code |  |
| 190 | reliability | TunnelManager keep-alive: guard check happens after `verifyTunnel()` call — one wasted network probe after disconnect; add guard before sleep |  |
| 191 | reliability | OlcrtcURI: invalid payload key-value pairs silently dropped — log warning for malformed values (e.g. `vp8-batch=abc`) |  |
| 192 | build | SSHRunner `_execute()` / `_withConnection()`: missing `@discardableResult` on internal helpers — will produce compiler warnings when warnings enabled |  |
| 193 | observability | Provisioning.start() and probeReadiness() missing LogStore.startSession() — inconsistent with all other Provisioner methods |  |
| 194 | reliability | NetPing: timeout DispatchWorkItem not cancelled after connection succeeds — fires anyway and wastes resources |  |
| 195 | reliability | SubscriptionFetcher: silent empty-string fallback when data can't be decoded as UTF-8 or latin1 — corrupted data treated as valid empty response |  |
| 196 | reliability | ConnectionStore.load: JSON decode failure is silent — corrupted UserDefaults loses all connections with no log or user notification |  |
| 197 | security | OlcrtcConnection.socksPass is Codable — if struct is ever encoded outside ConnectionStore.scrub() path, password leaks to JSON |  |
| 198 | reliability | OlcrtcURI: mixed bracket types in payload (e.g. `transport[bad>@room`) silently misparse — no guard against malformed bracket nesting |  |
| 199 | reliability | AddConnectionView: @State form fields not reset when sheet re-presented in create mode — old values persist from previous session |  |
| 200 | reliability | SettingsView: socksPassLoaded flag not reset on sheet disappear — SOCKS password not reloaded if changed externally |  |
| 201 | reliability | AddServerHostView: Test SSH Task not cancelled on sheet dismiss — updates @State after view gone causing SwiftUI warnings |  |
| 202 | reliability | LogsView: cachedFullText not updated when selected category changes — switching tabs shows stale log from previous category |  |
| 203 | performance | LogStore.timestamp(): DateFormatter created on every log call — cache as static let to avoid 60×/sec allocations during slider drag |  |
| 204 | performance | LogStore.redactSecrets(): two NSRegularExpression compiled on every log call — cache as static let |  |
| 205 | reliability | SpeedTest: result.error always nil even when all measurements fail — can't distinguish "all nil = all failed" from "all nil = not run yet" |  |
| 206 | reliability | InstallOptionsView: SEI params (seiFPS/Batch/Frag/ACK) not reset when transport changes away from seichannel — stale values submitted |  |
| 207 | observability | ServersView: readiness[host.id] not cleared at start of operation — stale dot/label shows briefly between op start and probe result |  |
| 208 | ux | AddServerHostView: "Test SSH" button label hardcoded EN — needs L10n key |  |
| 209 | ux | ServersView: deep uninstall confirmation body hardcoded EN — needs L10n key |  |
| 210 | accessibility | QRCodeView: QR image has no accessibilityLabel — screen readers can't describe it |  |
| 211 | accessibility | FormField: label text not linked to input via accessibilityLabel — screen readers can't associate them |  |
| 212 | accessibility | ConnectionsView speed metrics: Ping/DL/UL VStack not accessible as a unit — screen reader reads raw numbers without context |  |
| 213 | reliability | SSHRunner.shellSafe(): uses `.reduce(into:)` appending unicodeScalars — use `String(s.unicodeScalars.filter{...})` single allocation instead |  |
| 214 | ux | Manage VPS global status banner: replace with per-server inline progress inside host card — global banner makes no sense with multiple servers |  |
| 215 | ux | VPS action buttons: switch to icon-only (no text labels) with tooltip; duplicate all actions in context menu with same icons |  |
| 216 | ux | IP Check: collapse to "✓ 5.42.103.58 (3 sources)" when all agree; expand with ⚠️ only when IPs differ (potential DNS leak) |  |
| 217 | observability | Log levels: add multi-level system (Off/Error/Info/Debug/Verbose); current debug=Info, add Verbose for all Pion noise; filter duplicated-packet/TURN-refresh below Verbose; setting in Settings |  |
| 218 | architecture | SSHRunner: `withConnection` (private) is a trivial wrapper around `_withConnection` — delete wrapper, call `_withConnection` directly or rename | wrapper already gone; fixed stale comments to _withConnection/_execute |
| 219 | l10n | Delete dead `L10n` case `errorPortAllBusy_fmt` | already removed; key absent from codebase |
| 220 | l10n | Remove unused `L10n` keys | already removed; none of the listed keys remain |
| 221 | migration | srv.sh: complete rewrite for YAML-only binary (olcrtc no longer accepts CLI flags — server is broken) | srv.sh rewritten for YAML (server.yaml + ./cmd/olcrtc build) |
| 222 | migration | SSHRunner.reconfigureScript: rewrite to edit YAML fields instead of sed-on-CLI-args (completely broken after 221) |  |
| 223 | build | Mobile.xcframework rebuild: add SetLivenessOptions + SetSocksListenHost; remove dead SetLink |  |
| 224 | parity | Jazz carrier: remove from CarrierTransportMatrix (SaluteJazz deleted from upstream binary — server rejects it) | removed from CarrierTransportMatrix + carriers list |
| 225 | parity | Jitsi carrier: update CarrierTransportMatrix cells with real e2e data + defaultTransport() |  |
| 226 | migration | srv.sh: add Jitsi env-var support (OLCRTC_JITSI_URL, URL-format room IDs, Jitsi as new default) |  |
| 227 | build | Go-build path in updateScript wrong after #221 | `updateScript` now builds `-o olcrtc ./cmd/olcrtc` (was `/usr/local/bin/olcrtc .`), matching srv.sh + the `/app` entrypoint so restart picks up the rebuild |
| 228 | migration | parity_check.py: rebase onto new upstream srv.sh (YAML-based; virtually all base lines changed) |  |
| 229 | parity | OlcrtcURI.encode(): stop emitting %clientID (server YAML has no client_id filter; format removed from upstream URI) |  |
| 230 | parity | TunnelManager: call SetLivenessOptions() on start | MobileSetLivenessOptions(30s/10s/3) in runMobile, before start; complements app keep-alive |
| 231 | parity | CarrierTransportMatrix: update cells (jitsi now real data; jazz removed; vp8 multi-client fix; SEI defaults changed) |  |
| 232 | parity | Align golang image tag across all sites | pinned srv.sh + readiness + deep-uninstall to `golang:1.26-alpine3.22` |
| 233 | docs | Remove superseded UPSTREAM_MIGRATION_PLAN.md (migration complete via #221–#229; doc deleted, TODO pointers updated) | doc deleted as superseded; TODO pointers updated |
| 234 | features | Expose MobilePing() / MobileCheck() in TunnelManager for richer per-connection tunnel health checks | TunnelManager.ping() via MobilePing on a free ephemeral port + per-row UI chip |
| 236 | l10n | Hardcoded EN UI strings bypass L10n — RU users saw English | localized ~12 strings via new L10n keys (EN+RU) |
| 237 | l10n | Localize hardcoded picker/section labels in option views | Carrier/Transport/Room ID labels localized |
| 238 | docs | Russian code comments → English | translated SettingsStore `LogLevel` + Provisioning comments |
| 239 | docs | L10n.swift case annotations Russian → English | 95 annotations converted to the English source string (scripted from `L10nTable.english`) |
| 240 | docs | README stale | rewrote project-structure tree to the real layout, dropped dead refs (build-number.txt/Jazz), added the 3-layer note + AGENTS/CONTRIBUTING links |
| 241 | ux | Brand-name casing inconsistent — pick one | brand = `OlcRTC` for display (added `CFBundleDisplayName`); lowercase `olcrtc` for technical IDs + `Olcrtc` Swift type prefix; renamed `OlcRTCiOSApp`→`OlcrtcApp`; convention documented in CONTRIBUTING |
| 242 | features | `MobileCheck()` "Ready in Xms" metric per connection | `TunnelManager.checkReady()` via `MobileCheck` on a free ephemeral port; stopwatch "Ready Xms" overlay on the ping chip (long-press + context menu) |
| 243 | architecture | Protocol-agnostic `TunnelEngine` seam for a 2nd protocol | extracted `TunnelEngine` protocol + `OlcrtcEngine` (owns all `Mobile*`); `TunnelManager` is now protocol-agnostic (dropped `import Mobile`), dispatches via `ConnectionDetails.engine`; unblocks the #063 mock-engine testing seam |
| 244 | build | Replace placeholder bundle IDs before TestFlight/App Store | set to com.alexk.olcrtc-ios{,-tests} |
| 245 | docs | `OlcrtcConnection.swift` references missing `docs/uri.md` | created `docs/uri.md` (olcrtc:// URI format reference) |
| 246 | build | GitHub issue templates (bug report + feature request) | added `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — bug_report + feature_request + config.yml (English, iOS-flavoured; core/protocol bugs routed upstream) |
| 248 | build | App icon — `AppIcon.appiconset` ships with no images | added user's pixel-hand + `olcrtc-ios` wordmark → `AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png` (1024 universal); reproducible via `scripts/icon/make-icon.py` |
| 249 | build | Privacy manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) — required for App Store | added `App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`: no tracking, empty tracking-domains/collected-data; required-reason audit found only User Defaults → `CA92.1`; auto-bundled to Resources via the `App` glob, `plutil`-lint clean |
| 250 | build | CI: build + test (+ `srv.sh` parity) on a macOS runner | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on push/PR/dispatch (macos-15): parity check → gomobile-build `Mobile.xcframework` (cached by upstream commit) → `xcodegen` → `xcodebuild test` on iPhone 16 sim |
| 252 | docs | README publication pass — public framing, screenshots, disclaimer | restructured for a serious-project layout (badges, Features, Screenshots placeholder, Contributing, neutral Disclaimer); corrected stale architecture docs (connect→start→runEngine per #243, ATS/`NWConnection` attribution, test coverage); set `haritos90/olcrtc-ios` links; dropped censorship/RU framing |
| 253 | build | `Mobile.xcframework` distribution for public cloners | GitHub Releases channel (vs git-lfs): `release.yml` builds/zips/attaches `Mobile.xcframework.zip` per `v*` tag; `scripts/fetch-framework.sh` one-line-downloads it via `gh`, `scripts/build-framework.sh` is the shared from-source fallback (also used by `ci.yml`); README rewritten download-first |
| 255 | build | SwiftLint config + CI lint step | lenient `.swiftlint.yml` (excludes the vendored core + generated framework; disables the house-style-divergent rules — identifier_name/type_name/todo/line_length + length/complexity/param-count/`large_tuple`; `force_cast`/`force_try`→warning) + a parallel `lint` job in `ci.yml` (source-only, installs swiftlint if the runner image lacks it, non-strict so warnings annotate but don't fail). Lenient start; tighten to `--strict` over time |
| 256 | reliability | Default Jitsi server: all users point at one public instance (`meet1.arbitr.ru`) | exposed the Jitsi base URL as an editable, pre-filled field in the install sheet (shown for the jitsi carrier) + a "shared public instance — point at your own" footer (en+ru), so users aren't silently funnelled onto one third party; `InstallOptions.jitsiBaseURL` (defaults to `AppConstants.defaultJitsiBaseURL`, never sent empty) → `SSHRunner` sends the user's value as `OLCRTC_JITSI_URL`; `srv.sh` untouched (still reads the var; its `:-` default stays the server-side fallback), parity tests green |
| 258 | ux | UI redesign — adopt unified design system across all screens | builds 212–216: `App/UI/Theme.swift` + `DesignSystem.swift` (8 components + OlcStatusDot/FlowLayout/OlcEmptyState, dark previews); ServersView (single-source `HostDisplay` model — kills the VPS status-jump), ConnectionsView, all sheets, LogsView, SettingsView restyled; app forced dark via `UIUserInterfaceStyle=Dark`. One button system / one overflow menu / one status vocabulary / one large-title header. Follow-ups split out: #259 (state-machine tests), #261–267 (polish/architecture) |
| 259 | tests | Tests for the VPS `HostDisplay` state machine (#258) | extracted the #258 transition rules into a pure reducer on `HostBase`/`HostDisplay` (`seed`/`start`/`advanced`/`terminalBase`/`failed`/`retryBase`) that `ServersView` now drives; `Tests/HostDisplayTests.swift` (16 tests → 182 total) covers readiness→base mapping, op `target`/`phases`, no-optimistic-base-while-running, monotonic+capped phases, probe-authoritative terminal assignment, and failure→Retry `previousBase` restore. Reducer still lives in ServersView.swift → moving it to Models is #263 |
| 260 | reliability | Integrate upstream olcrtc (587c13e → e2c4b1e) | bumped submodule pin (jitsi reconnect #82/#88/#89, vp8channel byte-rate pacer, videochannel ffmpeg→`gocodec`; nested `gr` submodule removed — now a go.mod dep `gr v0.1.5`); rebuilt `Mobile.xcframework` via `build-framework.sh` (Mobile* API unchanged → engine compiles), `parity_check.py` clean (srv.sh unchanged), app builds + 182 tests green. No doc churn — our docs never named the `gr` submodule and `--recursive` stays valid. Hijacked doc commit only touches upstream `readme.md`/`westand.svg`, not propagated. PENDING USER: on-device jitsi+vp8 smoke-test; commit+push the pin bump; cut a new `v*` tag so `release.yml` republishes the framework |
| 261 | l10n | Promote ServersView hardcoded status/phase strings to L10n | localized the design-system VPS status text — `HostBase.title`/`.subtitle`, `HostOp.verb`, the «Connecting…» initial note, «Check server», «Working…» and the «%@ failed» title — via 24 new `vps*` keys (en+ru). Replaced the never-displayed `HostOp.phases` arrays with `stepCount` (running subtitle = the live localized provisioner message; only the bar denominator is needed); updated the reducer + HostDisplayTests. Metric labels (Ping/Disk/RAM/Uptime) left as-is (not status/phase) |
| 262 | architecture | Shared sheet scaffolding + dedupe card-row helper | extracted `.olcSheet(confirm:icon:disabled:onConfirm:)` (an `OlcSheetChrome` ViewModifier — ✕ close + full-width primary footer) into DesignSystem; adopted by AddConnection/AddServerHost/Install/Reconfigure (AddServerHost keeps its keyboard toolbar). Promoted `olcCardRow()` into DesignSystem; removed the private copy in ConnectionsView and the 3 inlined modifier-stacks in ServersView |
| 263 | architecture | Move `HostBase`/`HostOp`/`HostDisplay` out of ServersView into App/Models | moved the 3 enums + the pure reducer into `App/Models/HostDisplay.swift` (behavior-preserving; ServersView 965→796 lines; 182 tests green) |
| 264 | ux | Restore the IP "last checked" timestamp in the Diagnostics card | re-added `ipCheckTime` (set after `checkAll`), shown as a clock + `HH:MM` caption under the IP result; no L10n needed (icon + localized time) |
| 265 | ux | AddConnectionView — manual URI entry | added a 1–3-line monospaced `TextField` (literal `olcrtc://…` placeholder) under the Scan/Paste buttons that auto-parses into the fields on change; restores typing / paste-and-edit that the redesign had dropped |
| 266 | l10n | Remove L10n keys orphaned by the redesign | removed 19 unused keys (uriPlaceholder, parseURIAction, typeField, ipLastCheck_fmt, speedTestTitle, statusUnreachable, connectionLine_fmt, alertPasswordMissingDetail, status{Running,Done,Error}Title, actionDisconnect/Ping/Status, sectionInfo, installResultSuccessNotice, rebootingInProgress, scanContainerRow_fmt, uninstallConnectionAlsoRemoved_fmt) from the enum + both dicts; verified zero code refs; L10nTests per-locale count stays balanced |
| 267 | ux | Runtime design-direction toggle (Refined/Console) in Settings | `SettingsStore.designConsole` (persisted @Published) drives the 6 direction-dependent Theme tokens (now `static var`: bg/card/segActive + control/card radii + card border); Settings «Theme» picker (Refined/Console); app reskins live via MainTabView's SettingsStore observation. Added L10n themeLabel/themeRefined/themeConsole |
| 268 | ux | Manage VPS card shows free disk as if used | disk `awk` field `$4` (Available/free) → `$3` (Used) in `SSHRunner.readinessScript` so the card shows `used/total`, consistent with the RAM line right below it; pure Swift, no `srv.sh`/parity impact |
| 269 | reliability | Reconnect on network-path change (`NWPathMonitor`) — Wi-Fi↔cellular handoff | always-on `NWPathMonitor` on `TunnelManager` (lazy-started first connect, never torn down); new `.waitingForNetwork` holding state — hero shows «Waiting for network…», global toggle stays on+enabled (flip off to give up); pure `nonisolated static pathDecision` maps loss→hold, regain→`reconnect(.restored)`, Wi-Fi↔cellular swap→`reconnect(.interfaceChanged)`, debounced 1.5 s and coalesced; `.disconnected`/`.failed` (down server ≠ path problem) + first-update baseline ignored; `bgKeeper` kept running while waiting so a backgrounded app self-recovers; reconnect funnels through `scheduleNetworkReconnect`→`start()` (the seam #270's backoff sink will absorb, #271 the room-settle, #272 the generation guard); `Tests/NetworkPathDecisionTests.swift` (14-case matrix) + `.waitingForNetwork` round-trip |
| 270 | reliability | Bounded exponential-backoff auto-reconnect (replace the one-shot retry) | replaced one-shot `scheduleAutoRetry` with `requestReconnect` — a single recovery sink both keep-alive loss and #269 (network regain/interface swap) feed; capped exponential backoff `backoffDelaySeconds` (2→4→8→16→32→60 s, base·2ⁿ clamped) over `maxReconnectAttempts`=6, then terminal `.failed` («tap Retry»), preserving the deliberate battery cap; idempotent (one loop at a time), a verified connect ends the loop so backoff resets, a network loss cancels it (resets on the round-trip), a manual connect/disconnect supersedes it; extracted `preflight` shared by fire-and-forget `start` + awaitable `connectAndAwait`, `runEngine` now returns `Bool` so the loop sees the *verified* outcome; `Tests/ReconnectBackoffTests.swift` (schedule + cap + overflow/negative guards); removed orphaned `autoReconnect_fmt`, added `reconnectAttempt_fmt`/`reconnectGaveUp` (en+ru) |
| 271 | reliability | Settle delay before reconnecting into the same room (ghost MUC presence) | carrier-aware room-settle on the auto-reconnect path: `EngineStartSettings.isReconnect` (true only via #270's `connectAndAwait`, false on user `start`) → `OlcrtcEngine.start` waits `rejoinSettleMs(carrier:)` after its `MobileStop()` before re-joining, so the prior session's MUC `presence-unavailable` clears first (jitsi/telemost 3 s, others 1.5 s — XMPP-MUC propagation lag, per the upstream `server.go` ghost-participant note); logged via `rejoinSettle_fmt` (en+ru); fresh connects skip it; `Tests/RejoinSettleTests.swift` pins the mapping + case-insensitivity |
| 272 | reliability | Epoch/generation guard in TunnelManager (discard superseded connect/retry results) | monotonic `connectEpoch` bumped in `preflight` per attempt + captured into each detached `runEngine`; new `isLiveAttempt(epoch)` (epoch matches **and** `state == .connecting`) replaces the bare `state == .connecting` guard at all four `runEngine` MainActor hops, so a fast disconnect→reconnect can't alias the new attempt's `.connecting` and post a result for the wrong session; `connectEpoch` is `private(set)` (test-observable); +2 tests (epoch advances per launched attempt; invalid connect consumes none) |

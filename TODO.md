# TODO

Task ledger for olcrtc-ios. Every task has a permanent numeric ID and flows
**Backlog → Open → Closed**. This is the single place work is tracked;
`AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` point here.

## How this file works

**Lifecycle**

1. **New task** → add a row to **Backlog**, and (if the title isn't enough) a
   block under **Details** with the full description.
2. **Work starts** → move the row to **Open**.
3. **Finished** → move the row to **Closed**, fill the **Resolution** column (how
   it was resolved — or `Won't Do` / `Duplicate` for rejected tasks), fill the
   **Release note** column (#315 — see below), and **delete its Details block**.
4. **Parked** → move the row to **Deferred** (the very end of the file) and fill
   its **Reason** column — blocked on something external (paid dev account,
   upstream-only work) or consciously postponed (low priority). Deferred tasks
   keep their Details blocks; revive one by moving the row back to Backlog or
   Open and dropping the Reason.

A rejected or duplicate task is also closed (Resolution `Won't Do` / `Duplicate`);
there is no separate "won't do" list. Detail blocks exist only for **Open +
Backlog + Deferred** tasks. Closed tasks are title-only history plus the
**Resolution** note — their full setup descriptions are intentionally not kept.

**Release note** (#315) — one short, user-facing "what's new" sentence describing
the change, filled in when the row is closed. `scripts/closed-tasks-since.py`
puts **this column** (not the verbose Resolution) into the GitHub Release notes;
put `—` when there's nothing worth announcing (internal-only change) — the
script then falls back to the task title. Rows closed before #315 carry `—`.

**Columns**

- **Pri** — `P0` critical (correctness / security / broken) · `P1` high ·
  `P2` medium · `P3` low / nice-to-have.
- **Eff** — `XS` ≤ 15 min · `S` ≤ 1 h · `M` ≤ ½ day · `L` ≤ 2 days · `XL` > 2 days.
- **Theme** — security · reliability · architecture · parity (server↔client wire
  contract) · tests · observability · ux · docs · build · l10n · features ·
  migration · accessibility · performance · settings.

**Sorting** — every table (Open, Backlog, Closed, Deferred) and the Details blocks
are kept in **ascending ID** order.

**Layout** — Open and Backlog come first, then their **Details** blocks, then the
**Closed** history, then the **Deferred** table last — active work and its
descriptions stay at the top, parked work sits at the very bottom.

**Table formats** — never delete a section's table when it empties; keep the header
rows so the structure survives and nothing has to be rebuilt from scratch. The columns are:

- **Open** / **Backlog** — `| ID | Pri | Eff | Theme | Title |`
- **Closed** — `| ID | Theme | Title | Resolution | Release note |`
  (#315 was: 4 columns, no Release note — `closed-tasks-since.py` still parses
  the old shape at historic git refs)
- **Deferred** — `| ID | Pri | Eff | Theme | Title | Reason |`
  (placed after Closed so `closed-tasks-since.py`'s Closed-section parser, which
  stops at the next `## ` heading, never sees the six-column rows)

When **Open** has no rows, keep the header + separator and leave a single placeholder
row — `| — | — | — | — | _(empty — promote one from Backlog)_ |` — instead of replacing
the table with prose.

**Next free ID:** 404

| ID | Pri | Eff | Theme | Title |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 362 | P3 | S | features | Subscription refresh-due trigger (#356 follow-up): `isRefreshDue` + stored interval/lastRefresh exist but nothing calls them — check due sources on launch / pull-to-refresh and offer or auto re-fetch |
| 368 | P3 | M | observability | #331 follow-up: split the install-poll startup tail by line origin — blocked: the poll body is summarised via onStep (not line-by-line logged to provisioning), srv.sh is parity-locked (no origin markers), and there is no real install capture to validate a heuristic |
| 381 | P3 | XS | l10n | importHint copy is stale — it says tap «Parse»/«Распознать» but AddConnectionView has Scan QR / Paste, and since #361 Paste also imports subscriptions; refresh the hint to match the actual buttons |
| 382 | P3 | S | reliability | TunnelManager.liveBoundPort (#351) is a nonisolated(unsafe) static written on MainActor but read off-MainActor (SOCKSSession.make from a detached verifyTunnel task) — a genuine data race; wrap it in an atomic like #372 did for lastTunnelActivityDate. lastSelfDisconnectDate (#333) turned out MainActor-only, so its nonisolated(unsafe) is merely unnecessary (its real bug is the logic gap in #394) |
| 386 | P1 | M | reliability | f21f0e3 review · #333: the same-port wait `Task` in `start()` (TunnelManager.swift:611) is fire-and-forget — `disconnect()` can't cancel it and its only post-await guard is `state == .connecting`, so a disconnect+reconnect during the ≤5s wait runs `preflight` for the OLD record (bumping connectEpoch last) and connects the wrong exit node; capture the epoch before the wait and store/cancel the Task |
| 387 | P1 | S | reliability | f21f0e3 review · #328: `CarrierEndpoints.resolve` reads `remoteEndpoint` on combined `.ready`/`.preparing` and `resolvedIP` returns a dotted `.name` verbatim, so it can hand back the unresolved hostname as the "resolved IP" (defeating the proxy-loop exclusion card) — read only on `.ready` and drop the `.name` branch |
| 388 | P2 | S | reliability | f21f0e3 review · #364: `runGroupPing` passes `store.primary` (a UI selection) as `pingGroup(connectedNode:)`, but the live node is `TunnelManager.lastRecord`; a row tap (`setPrimary`, no reconnect) desyncs them, so batch-ping skips the wrong node and pings the actually-connected one — a 2nd client in its live room. Expose the connected record from TunnelManager |
| 389 | P2 | S | ux | f21f0e3 review · #328: `activeOlcrtcParams` reads `store.primary?.details` (ConnectionsView.swift:521), so after the same primary/connected desync as #388 the carrier card shows the wrong carrier's host while `carrierHostIPs` (refreshed only on `tunnel.state` change) stay the old node's — wrong DIRECT-rule guidance |
| 390 | P2 | S | reliability | f21f0e3 review · #364: `pingGroup` captures `state`/`connectedNode` in a pre-loop snapshot (TunnelManager.swift:927), so a node that connects mid-batch isn't skipped and gets pinged (2nd client in its live room) — re-read state/connectedNode each iteration |
| 391 | P2 | S | reliability | f21f0e3 review · #371: `fetchViaIP` builds the HTTP request line from `url.path` (SubscriptionFetcher.swift:177), which Foundation percent-DECODES, so on the DoH fallback an encoded path (`/my%20sub.md`) is sent as `GET /my sub.md` (malformed/400) — re-encode the path (`url.query` is unaffected) |
| 392 | P2 | M | reliability | f21f0e3 review · #371: `NWHTTPSGet` ends the body read only on TCP EOF (SubscriptionFetcher.swift:294) — no Content-Length/chunked handling, so a keep-alive server that ignores `Connection: close` hangs to the 15s timeout though the body arrived; honor Content-Length / the chunked terminator |
| 393 | P2 | S | ux | f21f0e3 review · #375: auto-connect-on-launch calls `tunnel.connect` directly (App.swift:201), bypassing ConnectionsView.connectGuarded's `secretsLocked` check — the exact device-locked-at-launch case #375 targets still shows "Key must be 64 hex characters (got: 0)"; move the guard into TunnelManager.connect |
| 394 | P2 | S | reliability | f21f0e3 review · #333: `shouldWaitForOwnPortReleaseNow` classifies a busy port as "our ghost" by timing alone (self-disconnect ≤10s) — `PortAvailability.isFree` is holder-agnostic, so a foreign app grabbing the configured SOCKS port in that window triggers a 5s wait instead of the #308 fail-fast |
| 395 | P2 | S | ux | f21f0e3 review · #374: `autoPingLoop` returns permanently when auto-ping is disabled (ServersView.swift:427) and the id-less `.task` (line 99) won't restart on the toggle flip — re-enabling auto-ping on the same tab never resumes periodic pinging; sleep-and-recheck or key the `.task` to the toggle |
| 396 | P3 | S | ux | f21f0e3 review · #363: `subscriptionInfo(for:)` returns only the first record's source (ConnectionStore.swift:245) but groups key by `#name`, so two subscriptions sharing a `#name` show only one source's quota + a server count that mismatches the listed rows |
| 397 | P3 | XS | observability | f21f0e3 review · #367: `clearContainer` doesn't clear `peerCounts[serverPrefix]` (LogStore.swift:433), so after clearing a server's container log the header keeps a stale "👥 N peers" until the next rare count line |
| 398 | P3 | S | architecture | f21f0e3 review · #354/#366: the percent-decode fallback for incoming olcrtc:// links lives only in `handleConnectionURL` (App.swift:325), not in `OlcrtcURI.parse`, so paste/QR/subscription-body callers handle percent-encoded URIs inconsistently — centralize normalization in the parser |
| 399 | P3 | S | build | f21f0e3 review: `parity_check.py`'s forward-walk base-line accounting can report a dropped duplicate upstream line (e.g. a 2nd `echo ""`) as UNACCOUNTED and fail the build; latent today (current shortfalls fall inside patched gaps) but a future srv.sh re-sync could trip it |
| 400 | P3 | XS | architecture | f21f0e3 review cleanup: `ContinuationGate` is triplicated (NetPing + SubscriptionFetcher + CarrierEndpoints `ResolveGate`) — extract one shared single-shot gate type |
| 401 | P3 | S | architecture | f21f0e3 review cleanup: the `OlcrtcURI.Parsed → OlcrtcConnection` mapping with `?? 30/10/1200/1` sei defaults is hand-inlined at ~5 sites (App.swift ×2, ServersView install/reconfigure, ConnectionStore) — add an `init(from: Parsed)`/factory so the defaults live once |
| 402 | P3 | XS | performance | f21f0e3 review cleanup: gate the per-line log regexes (#367 `peerCount`, #377 password redaction) behind a cheap `contains(...)` pre-check — both run an NSRegularExpression on every ingested line incl. 200-line container fetches |
| 403 | P3 | S | performance | f21f0e3 review cleanup: ConnectionsView recomputes the carrier host (`baseHost`) and `subscriptionInfo(for:)` inside `body` on every render (e.g. during a speed test) — cache in @State / derive on change |

## Details (Open + Backlog + Deferred only)

### 112 — NetworkExtension packet tunnel

Full-device VPN (route every app, not just SOCKS-aware ones) needs a NetworkExtension
Packet Tunnel provider + the `packet-tunnel-provider` entitlement, which requires a paid
($99/yr) Apple Developer account. The standard pattern is to keep running the olcrtc
core as a local SOCKS5 and bridge TUN↔SOCKS5 with
[`hev-socks5-tunnel`](https://github.com/heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel) inside the
`PacketTunnelProvider`. This is high-effort / low-ROI and gated on the paid account.

### 115 — TestFlight

Stand up the App Store Connect app record and a TestFlight build for internal
testing. Prerequisites: a real app icon (#248), the privacy manifest (#249), and
signing (set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`). On-device testing over cellular and inside RU
networks is already handled by the maintainer — this task is only the TestFlight
pipeline (archive → upload → internal testers).

### 235 — Failover profiles: multi-carrier iOS install

**BLOCKED on #247.** Server-side failover is supported — `internal/config` parses
`profiles:` / `failover:`, and `cmd/olcrtc/main.go` drives them through
`internal/supervisor` (runs profiles in order; on a session drop it waits
`retry_delay` and advances, up to `max_cycles`). `srv.sh` could emit a multi-profile
`server.yaml`:

```yaml
mode: srv
profiles:
  - name: jitsi-primary
    auth: { provider: jitsi }
    room: { id: "https://meet1.arbitr.ru/myroom" }
  - name: telemost-fallback
    auth: { provider: telemost }
    room: { id: "telemost-room-id" }
failover: { retry_delay: 5s, max_cycles: 3 }
```

The blocker: client and server rendezvous in the **same conferencing room**, and a
profile switch changes carrier *and* room (`config.ApplyProfile`). The bundled
`Mobile.xcframework` is single-session only — `mobile/mobile.go` exposes
`Start`/`StartWithTransport`/`Stop` and imports neither `config` nor `supervisor`, so
the iOS client has no way to follow the server's switch; when the server moves it is
left calling an empty room. A server-only multi-profile install is therefore *worse*
than none on iOS. #247 (failover in the gomobile binding) must land first.

Once unblocked, the iOS work is: `InstallOptions` gains a list of `FailoverProfile`
(carrier + roomID); `InstallOptionsView` gets an "Add fallback carrier" button;
`SSHRunner` generates multi-profile YAML; `ConnectionRecord` represents a
multi-profile connection (which roomID/carrier to show); `TunnelManager` drives the
client failover loop exposed by #247.

### 247 — Failover/profiles in the gomobile binding

Prerequisite for #235. The server cycles failover profiles (`internal/supervisor`,
wired in `cmd/olcrtc/main.go`), but the iOS client binding
(`olcrtc-upstream/mobile/mobile.go`) is single-session and has no way to follow a
carrier/room switch. Expose a profile-aware client entry point — an ordered list of
carrier/room/transport that the client cycles through, mirroring the server's
`retry_delay` / `max_cycles` — or a lighter "reconnect across an ordered carrier list
until the server is found" loop. Needs upstream Go work in `mobile/` (the existing
`supervisor.Runner` is the *server* session runner; a client-side supervisor doesn't
exist yet) plus a `Mobile.xcframework` rebuild. Until this lands, end-to-end failover
on iOS is only achievable via an app-level Swift loop whose client/server convergence
is best-effort (they can sit on different profiles during the detection-skew window).

**Decision (2026-06-04): UPSTREAM-only — do not fork or patch the submodule locally.**
CI (`ci.yml`), `release.yml`, and every cloner's `fetch-framework.sh` build the framework
from the *pinned* upstream commit, so a local edit to `olcrtc-upstream/mobile/mobile.go`
would build on the maintainer's machine but break CI and every clone (the published
framework wouldn't carry the new symbol, and the Swift calling it wouldn't link). The
client entry point — sketch `StartWithProfiles(profilesSpec, clientID, keyHex, socksPort,
socksUser, socksPass, retryDelayMillis, maxCycles)`: cycle an ordered carrier/room/transport
list in the existing singleton slot, reusing `client.RunWithReady` with a per-profile
handshake-timeout advance, mirroring `internal/supervisor`'s `retry_delay`/`max_cycles` —
must therefore land in **upstream** `mobile/mobile.go`. Re-check on each `olcrtc-upstream`
pull (the #260-style integration); **close when upstream ships it**, after which the iOS
side is only an `OlcrtcEngine` wiring + a framework rebuild.

### 254 — CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Adopt the standard Contributor Covenant. The only decision is the enforcement-contact
method (a maintainer email, or "via GitHub private report") to fill the template
placeholder. Community-health hygiene; not blocking the first push.

### 257 — Privacy-policy document

App Store submission requires a privacy-policy URL even when the app collects nothing.
Write a short policy ("no personal data collected or transmitted; the encryption key and
SSH credentials never leave the device / Keychain") and host it (GitHub Pages or a gist),
then link it from App Store Connect and the README. Distinct from the in-bundle privacy
manifest (#249).

### 329 — Kick participants + close the room on server stop

When the olcrtc server stops it only removes its own participant; the room and
any other participants linger until the carrier's SFU idle/empty timeout.
Wanted: on stop, actively kick everyone and end the room — gated by
`OLCRTC_CLOSE_ROOM_ON_STOP` (default ON). **UPSTREAM-only**; the iOS side is a
Settings toggle + the env var through `srv.sh` (boc-patched) once upstream lands.

**Per-carrier reality (core at pin 9822def + operator's in-call observation):**
- **jitsi** — feasible, and more broadly than first scoped. The olcrtc server
  CREATES/joins the room early, so on Jitsi it commonly holds moderator (often
  owner) affiliation — the operator confirms a "kick participant" control is shown
  in-call even on a server-created room on public/default deployments, not just
  self-hosted. The j library exposes only raw `Conn.Send`/`SendIQWait`, so the
  clean path is new exported helpers on the `zarazaex69/j` fork: `KickAll(ctx)` —
  for each occupant != self, a muc#admin IQ setting `role='none'` (needs the
  MODERATOR role we already have) — and/or `DestroyRoom(ctx)` — a muc#owner
  `<destroy/>` IQ that ends the room in one shot (needs OWNER). jitsi `Close()`
  calls them (~2s budget) and falls back to today's graceful leave on
  `<forbidden/>`/timeout for the rare locked-down host.
- **telemost (goolom)** and **wbstream (livekit)** — join as SPEAKER / guest with
  no end/kick API; they already self-leave on `Close()` and the SFU expires the
  empty room. Under the flag these are documented no-ops (log once).

**Fork-PR plan (operator does this in a fork, then closes this task):**
1. j fork: add `func (s *Session) KickAll(ctx) error` (muc#admin `role='none'` per
   occupant; needs moderator) and `func (s *Session) DestroyRoom(ctx) error`
   (muc#owner `<destroy/>`; needs owner). Typed error on `<forbidden/>`; unit-test
   the IQ XML. 2. olcrtc: add `CloseRoomOnStop bool` to engine/transport/server
   Config, thread it through `internal/app/session` + `pkg/olcrtc/tunnel`, resolve
   from `OLCRTC_CLOSE_ROOM_ON_STOP` (default true, only `0`/`false`/`no` disables);
   bump go.mod to the new j. 3. jitsi `Close()`: when the flag is set, try
   `DestroyRoom`, fall back to `KickAll`, then to today's graceful leave on
   forbidden/timeout. 4. goolom/livekit: log the no-op. Tests: jitsi_test
   (kick/destroy IQ on Close when on, not when off, fallback on forbidden) + a
   config env-default test.
5. iOS (separate, once landed): `SettingsStore.closeRoomOnStop` (default true) +
   a Settings toggle + export `OLCRTC_CLOSE_ROOM_ON_STOP` via `srv.sh` inside
   `# boc #329` markers (parity-checked). Close this task when upstream ships it.

## Closed

History of completed tasks. The **Resolution** column is a one-line "how it was
resolved" note for tasks closed under the current workflow; older entries are
title-only. The **Release note** column (#315) is the short user-facing line the
release notes use; `—` on rows closed before #315 or with nothing to announce.

Premise was stale — OLCRTC_SEI_* is end-to-end since the install sheet gained SEI steppers (UI → installEnv → srv.sh → URI), and "VP8-only" would drop working transports (sei/video are ✓ on wbstream/telemost). videochannel keeps installing with server defaults (ten niche knobs deliberately unexposed); the stale install-sheet footer that still claimed *seichannel* uses server defaults now warns for videochannel only; decision recorded at the installEnv NOTE + the srv.sh boc comment | Install sheet: the "uses server defaults" note now applies only to videochannel — SEI tuning has its own steppers |

| 253 | build | `Mobile.xcframework` distribution for public cloners | GitHub Releases channel (vs git-lfs): `release.yml` builds/zips/attaches `Mobile.xcframework.zip` per `v*` tag; `scripts/fetch-framework.sh` one-line-downloads it via `gh`, `scripts/build-framework.sh` is the shared from-source fallback (also used by `ci.yml`); README rewritten download-first | — |
| 255 | build | SwiftLint config + CI lint step | lenient `.swiftlint.yml` (excludes the vendored core + generated framework; disables the house-style-divergent rules — identifier_name/type_name/todo/line_length + length/complexity/param-count/`large_tuple`; `force_cast`/`force_try`→warning) + a parallel `lint` job in `ci.yml` (source-only, installs swiftlint if the runner image lacks it, non-strict so warnings annotate but don't fail). Lenient start; tighten to `--strict` over time | — |

One button system / one overflow menu / one status vocabulary / one large-title header. Follow-ups split out: #259 (state-machine tests), #261–267 (polish/architecture) | — |

Reducer still lives in ServersView.swift → moving it to Models is #263 | — |

No doc churn — our docs never named the `gr` submodule and `--recursive` stays valid. Hijacked doc commit only touches upstream `readme.md`/`westand.svg`, not propagated. PENDING USER: on-device jitsi+vp8 smoke-test; commit+push the pin bump; cut a new `v*` tag so `release.yml` republishes the framework | — |
| 261 | l10n | Promote ServersView hardcoded status/phase strings to L10n | localized the design-system VPS status text — `HostBase.title`/`.subtitle`, `HostOp.verb`, the «Connecting…» initial note, «Check server», «Working…» and the «%@ failed» title — via 24 new `vps*` keys (en+ru). Replaced the never-displayed `HostOp.phases` arrays with `stepCount` (running subtitle = the live localized provisioner message; only the bar denominator is needed); updated the reducer + HostDisplayTests. Metric labels (Ping/Disk/RAM/Uptime) left as-is (not status/phase) | — |
| 262 | architecture | Shared sheet scaffolding + dedupe card-row helper | extracted `.olcSheet(confirm:icon:disabled:onConfirm:)` (an `OlcSheetChrome` ViewModifier — ✕ close + full-width primary footer) into DesignSystem; adopted by AddConnection/AddServerHost/Install/Reconfigure (AddServerHost keeps its keyboard toolbar). Promoted `olcCardRow()` into DesignSystem; removed the private copy in ConnectionsView and the 3 inlined modifier-stacks in ServersView | — |
| 263 | architecture | Move `HostBase`/`HostOp`/`HostDisplay` out of ServersView into App/Models | moved the 3 enums + the pure reducer into `App/Models/HostDisplay.swift` (behavior-preserving; ServersView 965→796 lines; 182 tests green) | — |
| 264 | ux | Restore the IP "last checked" timestamp in the Diagnostics card | re-added `ipCheckTime` (set after `checkAll`), shown as a clock + `HH:MM` caption under the IP result; no L10n needed (icon + localized time) | — |
| 265 | ux | AddConnectionView — manual URI entry | added a 1–3-line monospaced `TextField` (literal `olcrtc://…` placeholder) under the Scan/Paste buttons that auto-parses into the fields on change; restores typing / paste-and-edit that the redesign had dropped | — |
| 266 | l10n | Remove L10n keys orphaned by the redesign | removed 19 unused keys (uriPlaceholder, parseURIAction, typeField, ipLastCheck_fmt, speedTestTitle, statusUnreachable, connectionLine_fmt, alertPasswordMissingDetail, status{Running,Done,Error}Title, actionDisconnect/Ping/Status, sectionInfo, installResultSuccessNotice, rebootingInProgress, scanContainerRow_fmt, uninstallConnectionAlsoRemoved_fmt) from the enum + both dicts; verified zero code refs; L10nTests per-locale count stays balanced | — |
| 267 | ux | Runtime design-direction toggle (Refined/Console) in Settings | `SettingsStore.designConsole` (persisted @Published) drives the 6 direction-dependent Theme tokens (now `static var`: bg/card/segActive + control/card radii + card border); Settings «Theme» picker (Refined/Console); app reskins live via MainTabView's SettingsStore observation. Added L10n themeLabel/themeRefined/themeConsole | — |
| 268 | ux | Manage VPS card shows free disk as if used | disk `awk` field `$4` (Available/free) → `$3` (Used) in `SSHRunner.readinessScript` so the card shows `used/total`, consistent with the RAM line right below it; pure Swift, no `srv.sh`/parity impact | — |
| 269 | reliability | Reconnect on network-path change (`NWPathMonitor`) — Wi-Fi↔cellular handoff | always-on `NWPathMonitor` on `TunnelManager` (lazy-started first connect, never torn down); new `.waitingForNetwork` holding state — hero shows «Waiting for network…», global toggle stays on+enabled (flip off to give up); pure `nonisolated static pathDecision` maps loss→hold, regain→`reconnect(.restored)`, Wi-Fi↔cellular swap→`reconnect(.interfaceChanged)`, debounced 1.5 s and coalesced; `.disconnected`/`.failed` (down server ≠ path problem) + first-update baseline ignored; `bgKeeper` kept running while waiting so a backgrounded app self-recovers; reconnect funnels through `scheduleNetworkReconnect`→`start()` (the seam #270's backoff sink will absorb, #271 the room-settle, #272 the generation guard); `Tests/NetworkPathDecisionTests.swift` (14-case matrix) + `.waitingForNetwork` round-trip | — |
| 270 | reliability | Bounded exponential-backoff auto-reconnect (replace the one-shot retry) | replaced one-shot `scheduleAutoRetry` with `requestReconnect` — a single recovery sink both keep-alive loss and #269 (network regain/interface swap) feed; capped exponential backoff `backoffDelaySeconds` (2→4→8→16→32→60 s, base·2ⁿ clamped) over `maxReconnectAttempts`=6, then terminal `.failed` («tap Retry»), preserving the deliberate battery cap; idempotent (one loop at a time), a verified connect ends the loop so backoff resets, a network loss cancels it (resets on the round-trip), a manual connect/disconnect supersedes it; extracted `preflight` shared by fire-and-forget `start` + awaitable `connectAndAwait`, `runEngine` now returns `Bool` so the loop sees the *verified* outcome; `Tests/ReconnectBackoffTests.swift` (schedule + cap + overflow/negative guards); removed orphaned `autoReconnect_fmt`, added `reconnectAttempt_fmt`/`reconnectGaveUp` (en+ru) | — |
| 271 | reliability | Settle delay before reconnecting into the same room (ghost MUC presence) | carrier-aware room-settle on the auto-reconnect path: `EngineStartSettings.isReconnect` (true only via #270's `connectAndAwait`, false on user `start`) → `OlcrtcEngine.start` waits `rejoinSettleMs(carrier:)` after its `MobileStop()` before re-joining, so the prior session's MUC `presence-unavailable` clears first (jitsi/telemost 3 s, others 1.5 s — XMPP-MUC propagation lag, per the upstream `server.go` ghost-participant note); logged via `rejoinSettle_fmt` (en+ru); fresh connects skip it; `Tests/RejoinSettleTests.swift` pins the mapping + case-insensitivity | — |
| 272 | reliability | Epoch/generation guard in TunnelManager (discard superseded connect/retry results) | monotonic `connectEpoch` bumped in `preflight` per attempt + captured into each detached `runEngine`; new `isLiveAttempt(epoch)` (epoch matches **and** `state == .connecting`) replaces the bare `state == .connecting` guard at all four `runEngine` MainActor hops, so a fast disconnect→reconnect can't alias the new attempt's `.connecting` and post a result for the wrong session; `connectEpoch` is `private(set)` (test-observable); +2 tests (epoch advances per launched attempt; invalid connect consumes none) | — |
| 273 | features | Release the "Direct" routing mode (`.allDirect`) | added `RoutingMode.allDirect` (case + `routingAllDirect` L10n en+ru) so the routing segmented control is a real 2-option choice instead of one pointless item; `ConnectionsView.currentMode` honours it (`.allDirect ? .direct : connected ? .tunnel : .direct`), so the app's own IP-check / speed-test / in-app `SOCKSSession` bypass the tunnel even while connected (a diagnostics kill switch — external apps on the SOCKS port are unaffected, the documented scope); persists via the existing `@AppStorage("olcrtc_routing_mode")`; `Tests/RoutingModeTests.swift` pins raw-value stability (persisted) + distinct non-empty titles | — |
| 274 | ux | Unify the two per-connection probes into one Health check | replaced the dual ping (#234) / time-to-ready (#242) chip — which alternated in one slot via a long-press overlay — with a single **Health check** action (overflow item + chip): one tap runs both isolated probes and logs one combined line `🩺 Health %@ — ready %@ · RTT %@` (`healthResult_fmt`, en+ru); the chip shows RTT (familiar latency pill), or the ready time in amber if only RTT failed, or a red marker if both failed. Underlying `TunnelManager.ping`/`checkReady` + engine unchanged — only the row UI collapsed. Removed 6 now-unused L10n keys (ping/checkReady result/failed/a11y) | — |
| 275 | reliability | "Container running" ≠ "connection healthy" — diagnose connect timeouts | a `MobileWaitReady` timeout means the WebRTC transport never readied — no peer rendezvoused in the room ("Link connected" with no "session opened"). The state used to show the bare Go reason ("Timeout"); `TunnelEngine` now keeps that in the log but surfaces a diagnostic, `connectNoPeer` (en+ru): "No peer joined in time — check the key matches the server, the room is correct, or try another carrier/transport." Also reworded `vpsSubRunning` so the VPS "running" pill no longer reads as "connected" ("Server process up — not a connection test" / «Серверный процесс запущен — это не проверка подключения»). Distinct from #282's verify-failure path | — |
| 276 | observability | Logs: one merged stream + per-entry source tag + level colour-coding | merged the per-category tabs into one chronological stream — `LogEntry` now carries its `category` + an inferred `LogLineLevel` (debug/info/warn/error) + a monotonic `seq`; `LogStore.merged` flattens every category sorted by (date, seq); LogsView renders a single attributed `Text` (one layout region — keeps it cheap) with each line tagged `[Source]` and colour-coded by level (error red / warn orange / info secondary / debug dim), plus a single-select **source filter** (All + per-category) that replaces the tabs; `classify()` infers severity (pion noise→debug first, then ✗/⚠ emoji prefixes, then keyword fallback) and IP-check lines finally carry a source tag; `Tests/LogStoreMergedTests.swift` | — |
| 277 | observability | Logs: dated timestamps + consistent newest-first order + retained scroll | `LogStore.format(date:)`/`timestamp()` now emit `yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss.SSS` (was time-only `HH:mm:ss.SSS`); the in-memory `LogEntry` carries the timestamp as a real `Date` (on-disk lines still self-describe with the inline stamp); the merged stream renders **newest-first** and no longer force-scrolls to the bottom on every append (kills the snap-back to old entries), so the view opens on the freshest line and stays where the user scrolled | — |
| 278 | observability | Server context-menu "Logs" → "Download container logs" + in-tab load/refresh | renamed the server-card context-menu `actionLogs` → `actionDownloadContainerLogs` ("Download container logs" / «Скачать логи контейнера») with an `arrow.down.doc` icon; `Provisioner.containerLogs` now parses each line's Go timestamp (`yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss`, carry-forward for continuation lines) so container output interleaves chronologically with the client stream instead of clustering at fetch-time, and records the host/container via `LogStore.noteContainerTarget`; the Logs tab gains a **"Refresh from server"** button (`logsRefreshFromServer`) that re-pulls that target directly (no trip back to the server card); `parseExternalTimestamp` also tolerates our own format so re-ingesting is a no-op | — |
| 279 | observability | Message catalog: typed, error-coded client+server messages, searchable + troubleshooting cross-ref | Wired the client OLC-1xxx codes: new OlcCode enum + LogStore.log(code:) prepends searchable [OLC-####] tags at the TunnelEngine/TunnelManager emit sites; Logs search matches codes; cross-linked docs/diagnostic-messages.md + README troubleshooting. Server OLC-2xxx wiring needs the maintainer's real container captures → deferred #378 | Logs: connection events now carry searchable diagnostic codes (e.g. OLC-1026) you can look up in the catalog and README |
| 280 | performance | Fix UI jank when changing font size while scrolling | the font-size `Slider` committed `settings.fontSizeIndex` on **every drag tick**, and that value drives `.dynamicTypeSize` app-wide (a full view-tree relayout) + a UserDefaults write — the stutter. Now the drag updates a local `@State fontDragIndex` only (re-rendering just the Settings row + a live preview); the app-wide value commits **once on release** via `onEditingChanged`. The preview text scales live through a scoped `.dynamicTypeSize`. (The Logs list, the worst offender, is already a single attributed `Text` after #276.) | — |
| 281 | ux | Make the Refined/Console design directions actually distinct | amplified the Console tokens from near-identical (±2pt radius / 0.5pt border) into a clearly sharper, denser terminal direction: tighter radii (card 7 vs 20, control 5 vs 13, segmented 5 vs 10), a *visible* hairline card border (1pt @ white 16%, was 0.5pt @ 8% — invisible), denser spacing (card padding 12 vs 16, section gap 14 vs 22), and monospaced caption/section labels. Refined stays soft + borderless. `Tests/ThemeDirectionTests.swift` pins them as distinct | — |
| 282 | l10n | `serverNotResponding`: reword to name the carrier server (not the VPS) + RU | reworded the carrier-failure state messages so they no longer read as the user's VPS: `serverNotResponding` → "Conferencing server not responding" / «Сервер видеосвязи не отвечает» (verify-failed path), `serverConnectionLost` → "Connection to the conferencing server lost" / «Связь с сервером видеосвязи потеряна» (keep-alive-loss path). The "RU shows English" was a build-221 artifact — both RU values already shipped on current builds; this is the wording fix. L10n-string-only (no keys / Swift touched) → no bump/build | — |
| 283 | l10n | Localisation gaps: "Servers" group + carrier/transport display names | (a) the canonical default group token "Servers" now renders via `ConnectionRecord.displayGroupName` → `L10n.groupDefault` at display time (RU «Основная») with no record migration; AddConnectionView stores the canonical token when the field is left at the localised default. (b) the carrier/transport pickers + matrix showed raw IDs — added `CarrierTransportMatrix.carrierLabel`/`transportLabel` (7 L10n keys, en+ru; "telemost"→«Телемост») wired into all three pickers + the matrix rows (selection value stays the raw ID). Documented the explicit-entry convention in CONTRIBUTING. Logs tabs/header were already covered by #276/#278. `Tests/DisplayNameTests.swift` | — |
| 284 | parity | Update the carrier×transport compatibility matrix data | re-derived every cell from the upstream authoritative table (`olcrtc-upstream/docs/settings.md`, from the E2E suite): telemost+datachannel `.ok`→`.fail` (DataChannel removed from Telemost), telemost+seichannel `.unknown`→`.fail` (unsupported), telemost+videochannel and wbstream sei/video `.unknown`→`.ok`, wbstream+datachannel `.fail`→`.question` (guest tokens canPublishData=false), and promoted the per-carrier recommended cells to match `defaultTransport` (jitsi+datachannel, telemost/wbstream+vp8channel). `Tests/CarrierTransportMatrixTests.swift` pins the key cells | — |
| 285 | reliability | Speed test over the tunnel: degrade gracefully + selectable providers + connection-type | the test "never worked on the tunnel" because vp8channel is a <1 Mbps covert pipe (raw VPS 775/318 vs ~0.77/0.51 through it), not a broken test. On `.tunnel` the run now degrades: serial (not parallel) measurements, scaled-down payloads (1 MB/512 KB vs 5 MB/2 MB) + longer timeouts, ping failure tolerated (reports "n/a"), partial results kept. Header logs the connection type (direct/tunnel + carrier/transport). Provider is selectable in Settings (`SpeedTestProvider`: Cloudflare parametric down/up/trace + OVH fixed-file download/HEAD, both verified) persisted in `speedTestProviderID`. On a slow video-transport tunnel it hints toward Reconfigure → datachannel. `Tests/SpeedTestProviderTests.swift` | — |
| 288 | build | CI: skip the build/test + lint jobs on docs-only pushes | `ci.yml` `push`/`pull_request` now carry `paths-ignore: **/*.md, docs/**, LICENSE`, so a docs-only commit (a TODO/README/catalog edit) skips the whole run (gomobile build + xcodebuild test + SwiftLint); any `.swift` / `project.yml` / `scripts/**` / workflow change still runs. `release.yml` is tag-triggered and untouched. Caveat: if CI ever becomes a *required* branch-protection check, `paths-ignore` leaves it pending on skipped runs — switch to a path-filter gate job that reports success instead | — |
| 286 | ux | IP-check: selectable providers (10, incl. RU/ru-zone) + connection-type | grew `AppConstants.ipCheckServices` to a curated **10** (7 international + 3 RU/ru-zone — `2ip.ru`, `2ip.io`, `ip.beget.ru`, all verified to return a bare IP over HTTPS with a curl UA, 2026-06; JSON-only endpoints dropped). The user toggles which to query via **checkboxes in Settings** (`SettingsStore.enabledIPSources`, persisted as an array, keyed by label), with a default subset (3 intl + 1 RU) and an empty-set fallback so the check never queries nothing. IP-check header now logs `→ IP check (Direct/Via tunnel) — N source(s)` (connection-type was already there). `Tests/IPCheckSourcesTests.swift` | — |
| 287 | observability | Log-line cleanups from the real capture | three fixes, two extracted as pure testable helpers: (1) keep-alive "active −N s ago" went negative because `noteActivity(forAtLeast:)` parks the marker ahead → `TunnelManager.keepAliveSkipNote(ageSeconds:)` reports "tunnel busy (Ns reserved)" for the future-marker case; (2) tunnel-verify "bad URL" (a valid URL whose SOCKS session can't be built mid-teardown) → `verifyFailureReason(_:)` maps `URLError.badURL/.unsupportedURL` to "proxy not ready"; (3) the port check-result line now routes through single keys `logPortFree_fmt`/`logPortBusy_fmt` (en+ru) instead of assembling fragments. `Tests/LogLineCleanupTests.swift` | — |
| 289 | performance | Logs tab: visibility gate — rebuild the merged stream only when on-screen | `LogsView.refreshCache()` (sort all categories + rebuild the `AttributedString`) ran on every `LogStore.revision` bump — once per log line — and `TabView` keeps off-screen tabs alive, so it churned in the background during a log storm on another tab. Added `TabView(selection:)` + `.tag`s in App.swift and pass `isActive: selectedTab == 2` into `LogsView`; the per-line rebuild is gated on `isActive`, with a one-shot catch-up `onChange(of: isActive)` when the tab is shown. Eliminates all off-tab rebuild work. On-tab burst smoothing (debounce) is the follow-up #290 | — |
| 290 | performance | Logs: debounce/coalesce the on-tab merged-stream rebuild during log storms | Won't Do — superseded by #294 (logs revert to per-source tabs; no merged stream left to debounce) | — |
| 291 | reliability | Speed test: OVH measures no upload + result units (Mbps/ms) no longer shown | (a) upload: a fixed-file provider (OVH) has no `/__up` sink, so UL showed nothing — `AppConstants.SpeedTest.uploadProvider(for:)` now routes the upload leg to the Cloudflare parametric `/__up` fallback when the selected provider can't upload (logged), so UL is measured instead of blank; (b) units: DL/UL lost their `Mbps` suffix in the redesign — restored next to the numbers (Ping already showed `ms`), matching this view's hardcoded-unit convention. `Tests/SpeedTestProviderTests.swift` (+2 fallback-resolution tests) | — |
| 293 | ux | Settings: move IP-check source selection into its own sub-screen | the inline #286 checkboxes now sit behind a navigation row ("IP check sources" + a selected-count) in the main Settings list; the toggle list moved to a dedicated `IPSourcesSettingsView` sub-screen. Model unchanged (`SettingsStore.enabledIPSources` + default subset + empty-set fallback) | — |
| 298 | ux | Settings: keep scroll position stable on font-size change (don't jump) | wrapped the Settings `Form` in a `ScrollViewReader` and tagged the Font row with a stable id; on `fontSizeIndex` commit (the app-wide dynamic-type relayout that moved the viewport) it `scrollTo`s that anchor (`.center`), so the Font control stays put instead of the list jumping | — |
| 299 | ux | Theme = real colour schemes (Dark/Light/Gray), not tile borders — replace Refined/Console | Added a .gray AppearanceMode (neutral mid-gray grounds 0x1C1C1E/0x2C2C2E via Theme.isGray; colorScheme → .dark) so the picker is now System/Light/Dark/Gray; removed the Refined/Console design direction entirely (SettingsStore.designConsole, Theme.console and all branches collapsed to the Refined values, the Direction picker, L10n themeRefined/themeConsole/directionLabel) and rewrote ThemeDirectionTests | New Gray theme, and the Theme setting now switches real colour schemes — System, Light, Dark or Gray |
| 292 | features | Speed test: add Hetzner provider (Yandex researched, no usable endpoint) | added Hetzner (`ash-speed.hetzner.com/100MB.bin`, fixed-file, no upload → falls back to Cloudflare per #291) to `AppConstants.SpeedTest.providers`; researched Yandex + several other RU/regional mirrors but found no stable small-file (1-10 MB) HTTPS endpoint suitable for the existing whole-file download path — documented in code comments. `Tests/SpeedTestProviderTests.swift` +2 | Speed test: new Hetzner server option (ash-speed.hetzner.com) |
| 294 | observability | Logs: revert merged stream → per-source tabs (Connection/Diagnostics/VPS/Container) | `LogsView` rewritten as a `TabView` with 4 tabs (Connection/Diagnostics/VPS via `LogCategoryTabView`, Container via `ContainerLogsTabView`); shared `LogRendering` (filter/newest-first/colour/plain export, `@MainActor`) + `LogTabHeader` (description + file name). `LogCategory.ip`/`.speed` → `.diagnostics` (`diagnostics.log`). Removed the `merged` stream and the #289 visibility-gate plumbing — `isActive` kept on `LogsView.init` for call-site compatibility but unused. Supersedes #290 (Won't Do). New L10n: `categoryDiagnostics`, `logsTabDesc*`, `logsFileNameLabel_fmt` (en+ru) | Logs tab redesigned: separate Connection / Diagnostics / VPS / Container views, each showing its description and log file name |
| 295 | observability | Logs: per-server container log files with a unique server-name prefix | `LogStore` gained per-server container buffers/files keyed by `ServerHost.logFilePrefix` (new `sanitizeLogFilePrefix`: alphanumerics kept, rest collapse to `_`, falls back to `"server"`); `startContainerSession`/`logContainer`/`clearContainer`/`noteContainerTarget` all take `serverPrefix`. `Provisioning.containerLogs` writes through the per-host prefix. `AddServerHostView` rejects duplicate names/prefixes (`isDuplicateLabel`, new `duplicateServerNameError` L10n). `Tests/ServerHostTests.swift` (new) | Each server now keeps its own container log file |
| 296 | ux | Container logs: always-present "Download from server" button + empty hint | `ContainerLogsTabView` (part of #294's `LogsView` rewrite) has a server picker (when >1 host) and an always-present "Download logs from server" / "Check server" (when offline) button, plus an empty-state hint that logs need loading from the server. New L10n: `logsDownloadFromServer`, `logsCheckServer`, `logsContainerEmptyHint`, `logsContainerSelectServer`, `logsContainerNoServers` (en+ru) | Container logs: "Download from server" is always available (or "Check server" while offline) |
| 297 | reliability | Fix freeze when opening Container logs for a server not yet checked | `ContainerLogsTabView.primaryAction` (#296) called `probeReadiness(containerName: nil)`, but `parseReadiness` always returns `.imageReady` for `containerName == nil` — "Check server" could never discover/adopt a container, a silent dead end that read as a frozen button. Now mirrors #302: scans for an existing `olcrtc-server-*` via `scanContainers` and adopts the first match. Every remaining dead end (missing password, no container found, fetch error) sets a visible alert instead of returning silently | Container logs: "Check server" now finds and adopts an existing container, and shows an error instead of doing nothing |
| 300 | ux | Port check: 3 states (free / used by another / used by olcrtc tunnel) | `PortAvailability.PortState` (`.free`/`.busyOther`/`.busyOurs`) gated on live `TunnelManager` state via `tunnelHoldsPort`, replacing the binary `isFree` heuristic in `SettingsView`'s port check; new `logPortBusyOther_fmt`/`logPortBusyOlcrtc_fmt` + relabeled `portInUseByOlcrtc` (en+ru). `Tests/PortAvailabilityTests.swift` +4. Follow-up: #313 | Port check now distinguishes free / busy by another app / in use by the olcrtc tunnel |
| 301 | features | New "Config" tab between Manage VPS and Logs (placeholder "Coming soon") | new `ConfigView` (NavigationStack + `OlcEmptyState` "Coming soon") inserted at tab index 2; Logs/Settings shifted to tags 3/4 and the Logs visibility gate updated to `selectedTab == 3`. New L10n `tabConfig` + placeholder strings (en+ru) | — |
| 302 | reliability | Server check: auto-detect existing olcrtc containers (no false "cached for reinstall") | `checkServer` now, when the readiness probe finds no *known* container on a host with `lastContainerName == nil`, folds in `scanContainers` and adopts the first `olcrtc-server-*` found — persists its name, sets the base to running/stopped from its status, logs `autoDetectedContainer` — so an existing container surfaces without the separate "Look for olcrtc containers" tap (still available for multi-container hosts) | — |
| 304 | ux | Move "Share connection" from Connections to the Manage VPS tab | extracted the share sheet into a reusable `ShareConnectionView` (QR now a `NavigationLink` push, not a second-sheet handoff) and moved the "Share connection" action onto the server card (shown when the host has a linked `ConnectionRecord`). Removed it (and its `shareConn`/`pendingQRConn` plumbing) from the Connections row menu; Copy URI / QR remain there as quick utilities | — |
| 305 | build | Release notes: auto-append tasks closed between releases (ID + title + resolution) | new `scripts/closed-tasks-since.py` diffs TODO.md's Closed table between `--since <tag>` and the working tree → markdown bullets `- #ID title — resolution`; `release.yml` runs it for `$PREV` and appends a "Tasks closed since <tag>" section to the notes (omitted on the first release / when empty / when the script is absent at an old tag) | — |
| 306 | build | Release assets order: `.ipa` before `Mobile.xcframework` | `release.yml`: build the unsigned `.ipa` before creating the release and make it the create asset, then attach `Mobile.xcframework.zip` in a follow-up upload — GitHub orders assets by upload time, so the user-facing sideload artifact now leads. Asset footer in the notes reordered to match | — |
| 307 | build | Per-version download counter for Release assets (GitHub API `download_count`) | new `scripts/download-stats.py` (stdlib-only) sums `release.assets[].download_count` per tag → markdown table (per-asset + per-tag + all-time total); repo from `--repo`/`$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`/git origin, token from `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` (one paginated `GET /releases`, within the unauth rate limit). New `download-stats.yml` workflow regenerates `docs/download-stats.md` weekly (+ manual) and commits only on change (`[skip ci]`). Surfaced via a README total-downloads shields badge + a link from the sideload section | — |
| 308 | reliability | SOCKS port: always bind the configured port (no auto-slide — breaks Shadowrocket etc.); busy → clear "port busy" error, don't connect | removed `PortAvailability.nextFreePort`/`autoRetryAttempts` (the auto-slide, reversing #108/#148); (a) `reservePortAndSettings` now does a single `isFree(configuredPort)` check → typed `.failed` before the engine starts; (b) `OlcrtcEngine.startErrorReason(_:port:)` maps a late gomobile bind race (`address already in use`) to the same reason; (c) new `errorPortBusy_fmt` L10n (en+ru) names the busy port, dropping `portChangedAuto_fmt`/`errorAllPortsBusy_fmt`; (d) catalog row OLC-1026 (E). `freeEphemeralPort` kept for probes. `Tests/PortAvailabilityTests.swift` (−3 slide tests, +2 error-mapping tests) | — |
| 303 | features | Recover/add a connection from server access when Connections is empty (import or generate) | added "Recover connection" host action (shown when a container is found but `lastConnectionID == nil`): `SSHRunner.recoverConfig`/`recoverConfigScript` read-only `cat` the deployed `server.yaml` + `~/.olcrtc_key`, `parseRecoveredConfig` rebuilds carrier/transport/room/key (+ vp8/sei tuning), `ServersView.recoverConnection` adds the resulting `ConnectionRecord` and links `lastConnectionID`. Import-from-existing only — "generate new key" fallback tracked as #314 | New "Recover connection" action rebuilds a connection from an already-installed server |
| 309 | build | download-stats: timestamp defeats the commit-on-change guard | `download-stats.py` now strips the `Last updated:` line before comparing the freshly-built doc to the existing file; if only the timestamp differs, the old file (with its old timestamp) is kept so the weekly workflow's `git diff --quiet` guard stays meaningful | Weekly download-stats workflow no longer commits when nothing changed |
| 310 | build | closed-tasks-since.py: `\d{3}` row regex silently drops task IDs ≥ #1000 | `ROW` regex `\d{3}` → `\d+` (header/separator/placeholder rows still excluded); `new_ids` now sorted with `key=int`; TODO.md header reworded "permanent 3-digit ID" → "permanent numeric ID" | Release-notes tooling now handles task IDs beyond #999 |
| 311 | l10n | Route speed-tile metric labels/units + upload-fallback log line through L10n | `ConnectionsView.speedRow` labels (Ping/DL/UL) and `"%.0f ms"`/`"%.1f Mbps"` formats, plus `SpeedTest.measureUpload`'s fallback log line, now go through new `speedLabelPing/DL/UL`, `speedPingValue_fmt`, `speedRateValue_fmt`, `speedUploadFallback_fmt` (en+ru, ru=en — universal abbreviations / deliberately-English diagnostic line) | Speed tile labels and units are now localizable |
| 312 | docs | README testing section drifted ("238 unit tests" + stale "port selection") | dropped the exact test count for "A broad suite of unit tests covers…"; replaced "port selection" with "port availability / busy-error mapping" (#308) | README: testing section brought up to date |
| 313 | reliability | TunnelManager doesn't track the actually-bound SOCKS port — port-check can mislabel "in use by olcrtc tunnel" after a live port change | TunnelManager now publishes `boundPort` — the snapshot preflight reserved (#308: bound exactly or the attempt fails) — set before `.connecting`, cleared in the state didSet on `.disconnected`/`.failed`/`.waitingForNetwork`; the Settings port check gates "in use by olcrtc tunnel" on `tunnel.boundPort == settings.socksPort` instead of comparing the configured port to itself; lifecycle covered in TunnelManagerStateTests. Follow-up filed: #351 (SOCKSSession/ConnectionsView still read the configured port while connected) | Check port now correctly identifies which port the running tunnel holds after you edit the port while connected |
| 314 | features | #303 "generate new key" fallback when server.yaml is unreadable/unparseable | New scripts/rotate-key.sh (ships as a bundle resource next to srv.sh): locates the deploy dir via podman inspect, salvages carrier/transport/room/dns/socks + tuning from the old server.yaml where readable, regenerates the key and rewrites server.yaml with srv.sh's verbatim commands (lines guarded by RotateKeyScriptTests — 105 lines checked against srv.sh, a real parity test without new infra), podman-restarts the container and emits the srv.sh OLCRTC_URI=/OLCRTC_CONTAINER= contract; SSHRunner.rotateKey + Provisioner.rotateKey reuse the upload channel and parseInstallResult; the #303 recover flow offers it only on a typed RecoverConfigError (never for transient SSH failures) behind a destructive confirmation that warns other devices lose access; non-jitsi rooms unrecoverable from a dead config → hard fail (reinstall is right). 7 L10n strings en+ru; loader generalized (loadBundledScript) with its dead dev-tree fallback path fixed | If a server's config can't be read during connection recovery, the app can generate a new encryption key on the server and restore the connection |
| 315 | build | Closed table: Release note column for curated GitHub Release notes | new 5th Closed column **Release note** (one user-facing "what's new" line, filled on close; `—` = fall back to title); `closed-tasks-since.py` emits `- #ID note` instead of `- #ID title — resolution` (5-col regex + 4-col fallback for historic refs); all 294 prior rows backfilled with `—`; documented in TODO.md header, AGENTS.md §5, CONTRIBUTING.md → Task tracking | Release notes now show short "what's new" lines instead of verbose task resolutions |
| 316 | ux | LogsView (#294) nests a `TabView` inside MainTabView's `TabView` — verify rendering; likely replace with `OlcSegmented` (the pre-#276 pattern) | rebuilt as a single `NavigationStack` (design_handoff_logs_theme §1): `OlcSegmented` category switch (short labels Conn/Diag/VPS/Container, full names via `accessibilityLabel`), ONE `.searchable` + ONE overflow menu, one file-header row (`doc.text` + monospaced file name + line count) attached to the log body; deleted the nested `TabView`, per-tab `NavigationStack`s, `LogTabHeader` (its description now opens the empty-state hint) and the unused `isActive` plumbing (App.swift call site included); per-server container picker/fetch (#295–#297) carried over unchanged | Logs tab redesigned: no more second tab bar — one header, a compact category switch, and a single file row with line count |
| 317 | ux | Unify ad-hoc `.red`/`.green` styles with `Theme.Palette` (#258 invariant) — AddServerHostView, AddConnectionView, SettingsView port check | Bare .red/.green in AddServerHostView (duplicate-name error, SSH test result), AddConnectionView (URI parse error), and the SettingsView port-check rows routed through Theme.Palette.red/green; existing status tokens sufficed — no new token. Follow-up filed: #350 (remaining ad-hoc colors in CarrierTransportMatrix/ConnectionsView/ServersView) | — |
| 318 | observability | Orphaned log files after #294/#295 linger in Documents/logs | `LogStore.init` now calls `cleanupOrphanedLogFiles()`, deleting `ip.log`/`speed.log` (merged into `diagnostics.log` by #294) and the old shared `containerLogs.log` (replaced by per-server files in #295), once per launch | — |
| 319 | reliability | Integrate upstream olcrtc (e2c4b1e → 39cc3fa) | bumped submodule pin (13 commits): server.go `reinstallSession` now closes the old muxconn before the session swap (fixes "frame too large" when a client reconnects faster than the server can push new-session frames into the dying smux session); jitsi engine hardening — `RequireTargetedPeer` drops untargeted broadcast frames before the peer-latch (already wired via `internal/client`, no mobile.go API change), bounded 30s rejoin-join timeout, RTCP keepalive only runs when a PC carries media/SCTP bridge, `PeerConnectionStateFailed` now triggers a reconnect instead of `onEnded`; muxconn/smux retuning (`inboundQueue` 256→128, `fastSpinAttempts` 200→16, `MaxStreamBuffer` 1MiB→512KiB, frames up to 32KiB); vp8channel default fps 60→30 + smaller KCP queues (CPU-reduction pass). Default Jitsi server list changed (`meet.cryptopro.ru` removed, `meet.small-dm.ru`/`meet.handyweb.org` added) — our `AppConstants.defaultJitsiBaseURL` (`meet1.arbitr.ru`) is unaffected, still in the list. `parity_check.py` clean — the upstream interactive Jitsi-menu/room-options rewrite in `script/srv.sh` falls entirely outside our non-interactive boc patches. Rebuilt `Mobile.xcframework` via `build-framework.sh` (Mobile* API unchanged), app builds + 265 tests green. Follow-up: #320 (re-benchmark our 60fps vp8/sei srv.sh defaults against upstream's new 30fps recommendation) | Reconnects after a dropped session are more reliable |
| 320 | parity | srv.sh `VP8_FPS`/`VP8_BATCH` (60/8) and SEI fps default (60) predate upstream's CPU-reduction pass — re-benchmark at 30fps before changing the boc defaults | Decision, no benchmark needed: the app always sends OLCRTC_VP8_* from Settings (default 60/64, "tested on Telemost + wbstream"), so the srv.sh boc fallbacks only govern non-app curl-piped runs — re-based VP8_FPS/VP8_BATCH 60/8 → upstream's post-CPU-reduction 25/1. The SEI premise was wrong: our SEI fallbacks already equal upstream's (60/64/900/2000). Mobile fps stays user-tunable via the Settings sliders | — |
| 321 | docs | README: rewrite the iPhone-install section around SideStore/LiveContainer + merge the build sections into one "Build it yourself" | README restructured: new lead section "Install on your iPhone (sideload)" — SideStore primary (one-time iLoader USB install, LocalDevVPN from the App Store for the on-device 7-day refresh, install via the Release-notes install link (#349) or `.ipa` import), LiveContainer alternative (LC+SideStore bundle via the same iLoader step, paste the `.ipa` Release link via **+**, apps inside the container never need re-signing), old AltStore/Sideloadly flow kept as a "Classic cable path" `<details>` block; Requirements + Build and run + Updating + the two build `<details>` blocks merged into one "Build it yourself" section (deps table → build & run in Xcode → unsigned `.ipa` → updating), placed after sideload and before Project structure; Troubleshooting `#build-and-run` anchor updated. All external links/claims verified against sidestore.io docs, LiveContainer docs, github.com/nab138/iloader and the LocalDevVPN App Store page | README: installing on your iPhone now leads with SideStore/LiveContainer — paste the Release link, no computer needed after one-time setup — and all build docs live in one "Build it yourself" section |
| 322 | build | Commit `bf48a75` message ("upstream parity update") is not Conventional Commits and omits the #297/#318 work — amend before push | amended before push | — |
| 323 | ux | Non-ASCII server labels collide on the "server" log prefix (false duplicate-name error) | ServerHost.sanitizeLogFilePrefix appends a deterministic FNV-1a hash suffix when non-ASCII chars are dropped, so Cyrillic-named hosts get distinct, restart-stable container-log prefixes (keeping the ASCII core when present); fixes the false "duplicate name" error on add | Servers with non-Latin names each get their own container log file and no longer trigger a false "name already exists" error |
| 324 | observability | IPChecker never calls startSession(.diagnostics) — IP-check lines miss diagnostics.log | IPChecker.checkAll now opens the .diagnostics session before its first line (mirroring SpeedTest), so IP-check results reach diagnostics.log even without a prior speed test | IP-check results are written to the Diagnostics log file from the start |
| 325 | parity | parity_check 2.0: two-way line-by-line check — rejected upstream lines stay in srv.sh commented with a reason marker; unaccounted upstream additions fail the check into a triage task | parity_check.py rewritten: classifies our lines (base / ours-in-boc / rejected) and upstream lines (adopted / rejected / unaccounted); new `# boc olcrtc-ios-rejected: <reason>` … `# eoc olcrtc-ios-rejected` blocks carry skipped upstream lines as `# `-commented verbatim copies; backfilled all 156 unadopted upstream lines into five rejected blocks (interactive menus, /tmp workdir, unconditional image pull, config-name prompt, gr-binary QR download); fails on base drift, stale rejections, and unaccounted upstream additions (error text: adopt or reject-with-reason + file a TODO triage task); base-order deviations warn only; both failure directions negative-tested; docs updated (README *How srv.sh works* + Troubleshooting, CONTRIBUTING *srv.sh parity*, AGENTS §3) | — |
| 326 | l10n | Connections tab: default group header says "Servers" — rename to "Connections"; "servers" wording stays Manage-VPS-only | Duplicate — implemented as #344 in the build-248 commit (en "Connections", ru "Подключения"; stored `defaultGroupName` token unchanged per #283) | — |
| 327 | features | Routing switch (Connections tab) only reroutes diagnostics (IP check / speed test), not the actual tunnel — make "All direct" apply to the SOCKS path too | Removed instead (operator decision: not currently relevant — revisit later): the switch only rerouted in-app diagnostics, never the SOCKS tunnel, and a real bypass needs upstream/core support (no bypass mode in Mobile.objc.h, verified 2026-06-12). UI + plumbing commented out under boc #327 markers in ConnectionsView (RoutingMode enum and L10n strings kept for the return); diagnostics now simply follow tunnel state | The Routing switch is gone from the Connections tab for now — it only ever affected in-app diagnostics, never the real tunnel |
| 328 | ux | Show the active carrier's hosts/IPs with one-tap copy (proxy-loop exclusions) | New CarrierEndpoints service derives the carrier base host from the connection (jitsi URL) + a DNS resolve pass (Mobile.objc.h exposes no live-ICE API); a connected-only "Carrier endpoints" card on ConnectionsView shows host + resolved IPs with one-tap copy, re-resolve, and an "add as DIRECT rules" hint | When connected, the Connections tab shows the active carrier's host and current IPs with one-tap copy to exclude in your proxy app |
| 330 | reliability | Edit sheet of the current connection: app hangs on open and on close | Consolidated ConnectionsView's three stacked .sheet modifiers into one .sheet(item:) enum (add/edit/qr) — multiple sheets on one view is a documented present/dismiss-hang cause that surfaced when editing the live connection under frequent re-render; the enum also snapshots an immutable record for editing instead of binding the churning live object | Editing the connection you are currently connected to no longer freezes the app |
| 331 | observability | Provisioning vs Container logs largely repeat each other — split by line origin | The container-log fetch (podman logs) no longer duplicates into the provisioning stream: SSHRunner._execute gained logBody:false for that fetch, which logs a single "→ container output → Container tab" pointer while the body routes to the per-server Container log (#295). Splitting the install-poll startup tail by origin is blocked on the parity-locked srv.sh → follow-up #368 | Downloaded container logs no longer also flood the VPS (provisioning) log |
| 332 | performance | Log pipeline causes UI freezes: slow disconnect, laggy Logs screen | File writes moved to a shared serial background queue (ordering + redaction-before-disk preserved); per-line revision bumps coalesced via LogUpdateCoalescer (leading+trailing throttle, ≤4 UI updates/s); entries/containerEntries de-@Published; LogsView refresh gated on tab visibility (post-#316 re-check: it observed the store even while hidden); rendered lines capped at newest 500 with a localized notice (Share/Copy keep full history). Unit tests in LogPipelineCoalescingTests. Follow-ups filed: #352 (on-disk rotation), #353 (lazy share item) | Disconnect is fast again and the Logs screen stays smooth even when logs pour in |
| 333 | reliability | Port reads "busy" for seconds after disconnect, blocking reconnect on our own ghost | Bounded same-port wait-and-retry on connect (poll ~250ms up to ~5s with a "waiting for port release…" status) gated on a self-disconnect within ~10s; the #308 contract is intact (configured port only, no sliding, typed busy error on timeout). Also resets lastTunnelActivityDate on disconnect and invalidates verifyTunnel probe sessions. Awaiting the core listener close is not possible today (MobileStop is void/sync) → upstream follow-up #380 | Reconnecting right after you disconnect briefly waits for the port to free up instead of failing with a false "port busy" error |
| 334 | ux | Container-log download shows no activity on the server card | LogsRouter.fetchingHostID drives a .progress busy strip on the ServersView card while that host's container logs fetch on the Logs tab | The VPS card shows a busy indicator while its container logs are being fetched |
| 335 | ux | Server card progress bar start: text overlaps for ~0.5s | statusRegion now always renders one status pill in a fixed top slot plus an always-present progress-bar slot toggled by opacity, so the pill no longer moves between states — clean transition | Fixed a brief text-overlap glitch when the VPS card progress bar appears |
| 336 | performance | App degrades over long sessions (suspected log growth) — profile to confirm; likely shares the #332 root | Shares the #332 root — closed by #332's rework: render cost is flat (newest-500 cap) regardless of session length, UI invalidations ≤4/s and zero while the Logs tab is hidden, file writes off-main, in-memory buffers already bounded (logBufferSize). Remaining suspect for any residue is unrotated on-disk log growth → #352; reopen if an on-device long-session check still degrades | — |
| 337 | ux | Hide IPs in the UI for screenshot-safe sharing | New SettingsStore.maskIPs (default off) + a Diagnostics toggle + an IPMask helper (keeps the last octet/group, passes hostnames through), applied display-only at the Connections IP-check rows and the ServersView host address; copy actions, stored values and logs stay real | New "Hide IP addresses" setting masks IPs in Diagnostics and on VPS cards for safe screenshots (display-only) |
| 338 | ux | Logs: inline container fetch with progress (design_handoff_logs_theme §2) | Container source card in LogsView: host chips ≤3 (primary connection's host first, ★; `Menu` picker beyond 3) + secondary "Fetch"/"Check server" `OlcButton` with `isBusy`; monotonic 3-phase progress (Connecting… → `podman logs --tail N <name>` → Receiving output…) with k/n + new shared `OlcProgressBar(fraction:)` (also replaces the Manage VPS card's `ProgressView`); `Provisioner.containerLogs` emits the third phase signal and writes a `── podman logs --tail N · HH:mm ──` divider (`.debug`/tertiary) via `startContainerSession(divider:)` instead of the generic "── new session ──"; empty buffer → `OlcEmptyState` with primary "Fetch from {host}" CTA; scan-first fallback (#296/#297 alert) kept; removed orphaned `logsDownloadFromServer` key | Container logs now fetch right inside the Logs tab with live phase progress and a session divider |
| 339 | ux | Logs: delete the container-logs popup; Manage VPS routes to the Logs tab (design_handoff_logs_theme §3) | deleted `ContainerLogsView.swift` + `ContainerLogsPayload` + ServersView's `logsPayload`/`.sheet`/`fetchLogs`; new `LogsRouter` (`@Published request: (hostID, autofetch)?`) owned by App.swift — ServersView's renamed "Container logs" item writes a request, MainTabView switches to the Logs tab, LogsView consumes it (Container category + host + auto-fetch via #338's phase UI, idempotent, skipped if a fetch is running); removed orphaned `emptyLogsTitle`/`emptyLogsHint_fmt`, `actionDownloadContainerLogs` → `actionContainerLogs` ("Container logs"); no SSH/Provisioner logic changes (stale doc comment fixed) | "Container logs" on a VPS card now opens the Logs tab and fetches right there — no more popup |
| 340 | ux | Light/Dark theme with System/Light/Dark picker (design_handoff_logs_theme §4) | persisted `AppearanceMode` (system/light/dark, **default dark** so existing users see no change) in SettingsStore; "Appearance" picker above the Refined/Console picker; `.preferredColorScheme` on the root in App.swift; removed `UIUserInterfaceStyle: Dark` from project.yml (it would override the modifier); Theme.swift `bg`/`segActive`/Console `card` + new `cardBorder` token now dynamic via `UIColor` trait closures per the handoff token table (Console light values applied mechanically — no further Console design work per operator decision; #299 stays open for the full Refined/Console replacement); audit found one hardcoded surface (OlcCard hairline `Color.white.opacity(0.16)` → `Theme.Palette.cardBorder`); light `#Preview`s added for the component set + all five tabs; CLAUDE.md dark-only invariant rewritten | New Appearance setting: System, Light, or Dark theme (default stays dark) |
| 341 | ux | Manage VPS card: fixed footprint + icon actions + compact metrics (design_handoff_logs_theme §5) | status region in a `minHeight: 58` container (pill / pill+bar / failed pill crossfade, no height change); metrics strip ALWAYS rendered — new one-line `OlcMiniStat` strip `PING 27ms · DISK 36/40G · RAM 241/2048M · UP 11d` ("—" placeholders, `.opacity(0.45)` during ops) replacing the conditional two-deck `OlcMetric` row; action bar = contextual primary + three 44×44 tinted `OlcIconButton`s (Check accent / Container logs green → #339 route / Reconfigure orange), logs+reconfigure disabled without a container, all disabled during ops, still a strict subset of `hostMenu`; `OlcMiniStat(label:value:tone:)` + `OlcIconButton(systemImage:tint:)` added to DesignSystem.swift; compact formatters `shortUsage`/`shortUptime` pinned by new `VPSStatFormattingTests` (269 tests) | VPS cards keep one fixed size in every state, with compact one-line metrics and three tinted quick-action buttons |
| 342 | ux | Connections: fixed-footprint hero + connect progress + speed units (design_handoff_logs_theme §6) | hero restructured: status row · ALWAYS-rendered two-line server line (mono subtitle reserves its line) · always-present hairline · fixed `minHeight: 44` footer slot swapping hint ("Flip the switch to connect via %@") / connecting (mono text + `HeroIndeterminateFill` — single `.connecting` state, asymptotic 90% fill, no fake steps) / waiting-for-network / SOCKS5 line / failure (2-line clamp) + compact 32pt Retry; conditional divider+row appends deleted; `OlcButton` gained `compact:` (32pt, same roles); `OlcMetric` gained `unit:` (smaller secondary text) — speed formats become number-only (`speedPingValue_fmt` "%.0f", `speedRateValue_fmt` "%.1f") with new `speedUnitMs`/`speedUnitMbps`, unit only next to a real number; IP-check block untouched (growth on disagreement by design); no TunnelManager changes | Connections hero keeps one fixed size in every state, shows connect progress, and speed-test numbers carry their units cleanly |
| 343 | ux | Settings regroup + DNS submenu + Appearance last (design_handoff_logs_theme §7) | section order now SOCKS5 (one section: port + Random + check + auth) → DNS → vp8channel → Connection (six sections merged into one) → Diagnostics (IP-sources link + speed provider, picker unchanged per operator decision) → Logs (three merged) → Appearance (language · Theme=System/Light/Dark · Direction=Refined/Console · font slider) → version footer; DNS chip wall → `NavigationLink` summary row ("Yandex · 77.88.8.8:53") + new `DNSSettingsView` subscreen (preset rows: name + mono address + checkmark, long dnsFooter moved there, free-form field + keyboard Done; also kills the MegaFon/Yota duplicate-ForEach-ID the chip wall had); one short footer per section (kept: socksPortChangeNote, footerKeepAlive, speedProviderFooter, footerLogBuffer, fontFooter); relabels: scheme picker "Appearance"→"Theme", Refined/Console "Theme"→new `directionLabel` "Direction", section header "Font"→"Appearance"; removed 10 orphaned L10n keys; every SettingsStore binding kept | Settings reorganized: cleaner sections, DNS picker moved to its own page, appearance options grouped at the bottom |
| 344 | l10n | Connections tab: default list group says "Servers" — rename to "Connections" | `L10n.groupDefault` display value "Servers"→"Connections" (ru "Основная"→"Подключения"); display-only — the persisted raw `ConnectionRecord.defaultGroupName` stays "Servers", mapped via `displayGroupName` (#283), so no migration | The connection list on the Connections tab is now titled "Connections" instead of "Servers" |
| 345 | build | Commit `05b3447` message ("no description yet") is not Conventional Commits — amend before push | amended before push (build-248 commit, `feat(ui): single-stack Logs tab…`). Policy fixed so this task type isn't refiled: a placeholder subject is the expected pre-review state — the local `/review-commits` command now hands the ready-to-run amend command instead of filing a task; the commit-review and batch sections (§7/§8) were removed from public AGENTS.md (operator-local workflow — contributors review their own way) | — |
| 346 | l10n | VPS-card mini-stat labels and the "Restored" alert are hardcoded | Routed Ping/Disk/RAM/Up and the "Restored: %@" alert through L10n (vpsStat*, scanRestored_fmt; ru = en for the abbreviations per operator, in-value units stay English) | VPS card stat labels and the restore confirmation are now localized |
| 347 | build | closed-tasks-since.py: skip Closed rows whose Release note is "—" instead of falling back to the title | Script now skips Closed rows whose Release note is "—"/empty (no title fallback), so service-task titles never leak into release notes; docstring + TODO header updated | — |
| 348 | tests | CI red on main: ConnectionStoreTests.testSaveLoadRoundtripPreservesAllFields — stale assertion after #344 | the test compared the persisted `groupName` against `L10n.groupDefault.localized()`; that held pre-#344 when both were "Servers", but #344 changed only the *display* value to "Connections" (raw token unchanged via `displayGroupName`, no migration), so the roundtrip assertion broke. Now asserts the raw token `ConnectionRecord.defaultGroupName` | — |
| 349 | build | Release notes: auto-generate SideStore/LiveContainer install links for the `.ipa` asset | release.yml "Build release notes" step now emits an "Install on iPhone" block before the asset footer: `sidestore://install?url=…` and `livecontainer://install?url=…` pointing at the tag's `olcrtc-ios-unsigned.ipa`, rendered as code spans (GitHub strips non-https schemes from markdown links — the reader copies them into Safari) plus a link to the README sideload section; the asset-footer line now names SideStore/LiveContainer alongside AltStore/Sideloadly | Release notes now include ready-to-paste SideStore/LiveContainer install links for the app |
| 350 | ux | Remaining ad-hoc colors → Theme.Palette (#317 follow-up) | CarrierTransportMatrix Compat.color + the matrix legend, ConnectionsView .tint(.orange) and the ServersView container-status colors routed to Theme.Palette; also made amber/star dynamic (bright yellow on dark, darker amber #B8860B on light/gray) so the progress dot, progress bar and "Main" badge stay legible on light themes | Status indicators stay legible on light themes |
| 351 | reliability | Live sessions still read the configured SOCKS port (#313 follow-up) | Added a nonisolated mirror (liveBoundPort/activeSocksPort); SOCKSSession tunnel-mode sessions and the Connections hero now use the port the live session actually bound, so a live port edit no longer tears down a healthy tunnel and the hero shows the real port | Changing the SOCKS port while connected no longer drops a healthy tunnel |
| 352 | observability | On-disk log rotation (#332/#336 follow-up) | LogFileWriter caps each log file at ~2 MiB and trims it to the newest ~1 MiB on a line boundary at session start (best-effort) | On-disk log files are capped and trimmed to recent history |
| 353 | performance | LogsView builds the full share/export string eagerly on every refresh | Added .shareLazy to OlcOverflowMenu; LogsView builds the export string only when Share/Copy is invoked, not on every refresh | The Logs screen builds export/share text only when you open Share or Copy |
| 354 | features | Plain olcrtc:// links open the app but import nothing (#111 follow-up) | App.handleIncomingURL routes a bare olcrtc:// link through the same confirm-then-add flow as olcrtc-sub:// (single entry, no subscription provenance) | Opening a single olcrtc:// link now offers to add that connection |
| 355 | parity | OlcrtcURI.parse drops seichannel payload params | OlcrtcURI now parses the payload by transport — seichannel's fps/batch/frag/ack-ms into new sei fields (no longer conflated into the vp8 fields), and encode emits the sei payload; the sei fields are also preserved across install/reconfigure in ServersView | Subscription/QR links using the seichannel transport now keep their fps/batch/frag/ack-ms tuning |
| 356 | features | Subscriptions 2.0 (#111 follow-up): persist source URL, honor #refresh, dedup re-imports | ConnectionRecord carries subSourceURL + subNodeKey; ConnectionStore.diffSubscription dedups re-imports (add/update-in-place/remove keyed by node identity); SubscriptionMeta persists the refresh interval + lastRefresh and isRefreshDue is exposed (the launch/manual refresh trigger is follow-up #362) | Re-opening the same subscription link updates your servers in place instead of creating duplicates, and remembers each list's refresh interval |
| 357 | parity | Sync upstream core 39cc3fa→9822def and re-derive the matrix | Bumped the olcrtc-upstream submodule to 9822def (jitsi RTP-keepalive fixes, RTCP-loop removal, transport reassembly cap, j/rtx-ssrc dep bumps; the gomobile binding mobile.go is unchanged), rebuilt Mobile.xcframework, and re-synced CarrierTransportMatrix to the upstream E2E ground truth (jitsi vp8channel → ok, seichannel → fail, videochannel → fail; +tests) | Updated the bundled olcrtc core for more stable Jitsi connections, and refreshed the carrier/transport compatibility table |
| 358 | performance | LogStore copies the entire log buffer on every appended line | Replaced the double-reference append with an in-place modify-accessor mutation, eliminating the full O(n) buffer copy on every log line during storms | Logs stay smooth during heavy log bursts |
| 359 | accessibility | Hero connect toggle and add-buttons have no VoiceOver labels | The hero connect Toggle gained an accessibilityLabel/value/hint (announcing connect + state + the disabled reason); the icon-only "+" buttons on Connections and Manage VPS got labels | VoiceOver now properly names the connect switch (with its state) and the add buttons |
| 360 | features | In-app update checker against GitHub Releases | New UpdateChecker: interval-gated (24h), anonymous unauthenticated GET to the repo's GitHub Releases latest, marketing-version compare; a newer release raises an UpdateAvailableSheet with the release page + sidestore://install / livecontainer://install deep links (mirrors release.yml); check-and-link only, off-able via a Settings toggle (default on), no install id. Pure version-compare + interval helpers tested | Sideload builds check GitHub Releases once a day and offer a one-tap SideStore/LiveContainer install link when a newer version is out (anonymous, off in Settings) |
| 361 | features | Import box: accept a pasted subscription URL or raw sub.md text, not only olcrtc-sub:// deep links | OlcrtcSubscription.detectImport routes a pasted single olcrtc:// link (fills fields), an https subscription URL (fetched + #356 dedup), or raw sub.md text (parsed) into the existing confirm-then-import flow; HTTPS-only for URLs. Detector unit-tested | Paste to import: the box now accepts a single connection link, an https subscription URL, or a pasted subscription list |
| 363 | features | Surface subscription metadata (Used/Available quota, source URL, per-node IP/comment) | OlcrtcSubscription retains global #used/#available and per-node ##used/##available/##ip/##comment; carried through diffSubscription onto ConnectionRecord + SubscriptionMeta; ConnectionsView shows a subscription-group footer (source / servers / refresh interval / Used / Available) and a per-row IP (IPMask-aware per #337) + note, rendered defensively. Tested | Subscriptions now show their source, server count, refresh interval and Used/Available quota, plus each node's IP and note |
| 364 | features | Batch ping subscription: health-check every node in a group, badge latency | TunnelManager.pingGroup runs the single-node ping sequentially with a unique per-node clientID, leasing an ephemeral port each time (never the configured SOCKS port, #308) and skipping the live node; a Ping-all group-header button badges each row with its RTT. Pure helpers tested | Ping every server in a group at once — each row shows its measured latency |
| 365 | ux | AddConnectionView: view/edit seichannel params (fps/batch/frag/ack-ms) | Added a SEI section shown only for transport == seichannel, binding the four sei fields (round-tripped via OlcrtcURI since #355) | You can now view and edit SEI channel parameters for seichannel connections |
| 366 | features | Recipient-side import of full-access (olcrtc://host/v1/) links | Switched FullAccessShare from a separate olcrtc-host:// scheme to the familiar olcrtc://host/v1/base64url(JSON) (no new scheme to register; distinguished from a plain connection URI by the host/ prefix). App.handleIncomingURL detects + parses it and shows a destructive confirm that, on accept, adds the connection AND registers the VPS host with its SSH password in the Keychain; #135's share side emits the same format. Tests updated | Opening a shared full-access link now offers to add both the connection and the VPS (with SSH access), behind a clear warning |
| 367 | observability | Surface a live peer count in the Logs tab from the server's log lines | LogStore parses the server's "Current peers count: N" lines (upstream PR #96) into a per-server peerCounts map; the Logs Container header shows the count for the selected server. Log-only, no binding change. Parser tested | The Logs tab shows a live peer count for a server, read from its container logs |
| 369 | accessibility | VoiceOver grouping for metric strips (#212 regression) | OlcMetric (speed Ping/DL/UL) and OlcMiniStat (VPS strip) now read as one combined element each; decorative separators hidden; compatibility-matrix cells got spoken "carrier transport: status" labels (reusing the matrixStatus* keys) | VoiceOver reads connection speed metrics, VPS stats and the compatibility grid as clear, complete phrases |
| 370 | accessibility | Sub-44pt hit targets (health chip, overflow menu) | The per-row health chip (28pt) and the OlcOverflowMenu ellipsis (32pt) now have a >=44pt touch region (contentShape + frame) while keeping their drawn size | The health-check chip and the (…) menu are easier to tap (44pt touch targets) |
| 371 | reliability | SubscriptionFetcher IP-pinned TLS sent the IP as SNI (broke CDN/SNI-vhosted hosts) | The DoH fallback now connects to the resolved IP via NWConnection while sending SNI/Host = the original host and validating the cert against it, so GitHub Pages / Cloudflare-fronted subscription hosts load when DNS is blocked. Parse/de-chunk tested | Subscriptions hosted on GitHub Pages or Cloudflare now load reliably when DNS is blocked |
| 372 | reliability | Data race on TunnelManager.lastTunnelActivityDate | Replaced the nonisolated(unsafe) static Date? (written from several concurrent contexts) with an OSAllocatedUnfairLock-guarded Double, preserving the get/set/reset surface. Concurrent-access test added | — |
| 373 | performance | QRCodeView re-rastered the QR + a fresh CIContext on every body eval | Hoisted a shared static CIContext and compute the image once per uri via .task(id:) into @State, so re-renders of the presenting view do not re-raster | — |
| 374 | performance | ServersView auto-ping probed every host each interval, even mid-op | The periodic sweep now skips while an SSH op is running, only re-pings hosts whose last ping is older than the interval, and staggers per host | VPS auto-ping is lighter on battery — it skips just-checked hosts and pauses during operations |
| 375 | reliability | Device-locked-at-launch yielded empty in-memory keys (misleading "key length 0") | ConnectionStore distinguishes a Keychain read ERROR (device locked before first unlock) from a genuinely-absent key; on error it keeps secretsLocked and re-hydrates on foreground, and connect surfaces an "unlock and reopen" message instead of the key-length error. Tested | If the app opens while the device is still locked it now says to unlock and reopen instead of a confusing key error, and recovers your key automatically |
| 376 | l10n | NSCameraUsageDescription was English-only | Added localized App/en.lproj + App/ru.lproj/InfoPlist.strings for the camera-permission prompt (the OS reads it from the bundle, so it cannot go through the runtime L10n enum); XcodeGen bundles them (knownRegions en/ru) | The camera-permission prompt (QR scanning) is now localized to Russian |
| 377 | security | redactSecrets scrubbed only the encryption key, not passwords | redactSecrets now also scrubs password=/pass: credential values (marker kept, value redacted) as defense-in-depth; prose without a value is untouched. Tests added | — |
| 383 | security | Full-access import stored the VPS SSH password even when the embedded connection URI failed to parse | importFullAccess now parses the embedded olcrtc:// URI FIRST and bails with a user-facing error if it fails — the host add + success log moved inside the guard, so a malformed link stores nothing (was: credentials written to the Keychain with no connection and no error) | A broken full-access link no longer silently saves the server password — it shows an error and imports nothing |
| 384 | reliability | Full-access import bypassed AddServerHostView's dedup + duplicate-name checks | Added pure, unit-tested ServerHostStore.resolveImport: re-opening the same link now refreshes the existing VPS card (no duplicate card/Keychain entry) and a name clashing with a different host is auto-disambiguated so the two never share a container-log file (#323) | Re-importing a full-access link updates the existing server instead of adding a duplicate, and clashing server names are kept distinct |
| 385 | security | Password redaction over-matched: bypass=/compass:/surpass= values were redacted in logs | Anchored _passwordRegex with a leading \b word boundary so only standalone pass/passwd/password markers redact, plus a cheap contains("pass") pre-check to skip the regex on most lines. Tests added | Log lines with words like "bypass" or "compass" are no longer wrongly redacted |

## Deferred

Parked indefinitely — blocked on something external or consciously postponed.
Not part of active planning. Revive a task by moving its row back to Backlog
(or Open) and dropping the Reason; its Details block (if any) lives on in the
Details section meanwhile.

| ID | Pri | Eff | Theme | Title | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 112 | P3 | XL | features | NetworkExtension packet tunnel | no paid dev account — `packet-tunnel-provider` entitlement needs the $99/yr program |
| 113 | P3 | M | features | SOCKS port per-profile (multiple simultaneous tunnels) | low priority |
| 114 | P3 | L | features | New protocols — vless / xray / reality / rprx-vision / awg 2.0 | low priority |
| 115 | P2 | M | build | TestFlight: App Store Connect record + internal-testing build | no paid dev account — App Store Connect needs the $99/yr program |
| 235 | P3 | L | features | Failover profiles — multi-profile install | depends on #247, which is UPSTREAM-only |
| 247 | P3 | L | build | Failover/profiles in the gomobile binding (rebuild xcframework; unblocks #235) | UPSTREAM-only — needs upstream binding work before any iOS side exists |
| 254 | P3 | XS | docs | CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant) | low priority |
| 257 | P3 | S | docs | Privacy-policy document (App Store needs a hosted URL) | low priority |
| 329 | P2 | L | features | On server stop: kick all participants + close the room, behind a setting (default ON) | UPSTREAM-only — needs core room-control support at server shutdown; the iOS side (Settings toggle + OLCRTC_* env var) is trivial once upstream lands |
| 378 | P2 | M | observability | Wire the server OLC-2xxx diagnostic codes (#279 follow-up) | blocked — needs the maintainer's real container/podman captures to map server conditions to codes |
| 379 | P3 | L | features | Real in-app live peer count over the control stream | UPSTREAM-only — needs a new control-frame message + a mobile.go binding addition (the peer counter is server-only/log-only today); the log-scrape path #367 is the cheap alternative |
| 380 | P3 | S | reliability | Upstream: expose MobileStopAndWait() / a listener-closed signal, or set SO_REUSEADDR on the SOCKS listener, so reconnect needn't poll the port (#333 follow-up) | UPSTREAM-only — olcrtc-upstream/mobile change; would retire the #333 client-side wait |
